## AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

- AWS **KMS** allows AWS to manage encryption keys for us
	- Integrated w/ IAM for authorization 
- Can audit **key usage** using **CloudTrail**
- Integrated into **most** AWS services

## Server-Side Encryption

- Data is **encrypted after** received by server
	- Data is **decrypted** before being sent
	- It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to key
## Client-Side Encryption 

- Data is **encrypted** by client and never **decrypted by server**
	- Data will be **decrypted** by a **receiving client**
	- The server **should not decrypt** data

### Key Types

- **Symmetric (AES-256)**: Single encryption key for encryption + decryption
	- Integrated services use this 
	- **Never get access to unencrypted key**
	- **GenerateDataKey**: Generates a unique symmetric data key (DEK); returns plaintext and encrypted copies of data key
	- **GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext**: Self-explanatory
	- **Decrypt**: Decrypt <=4KB of data
	- **GenerateRandom**: Generates random byte string
- **Asymmetric (RSA + ECC)**: Pair of encryption (public)/decryption(private) keys 
	- Used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify ops
	- Public key is **downloadable** but you can't use the private key unencrypted
	- Good for encryption **outside AWS** 
- **AWS Owned Keys (free)**: SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (default)
- **AWS Managed Key (free)**: `aws/service-name`
---
- Customer-managed keys are **$1/mo** + **$0.03/1K API calls**
- AWS-managed keys are rotated **every year**
	- Imported keys must be **manually rotated**
	- Customer-managed keys can be **automatically** rotated or rotated **on-demand**

### Key Policies

- **Key Policies** control access to KMS keys; **you cannot control access without these**
- **Default Key Policy**: Gives complete access to root user 
- **Custom Key Policies** allow you to define users/roles that get access, who can administer, etc. 

### Envelope Encryption

- Encrypt API has a limit of **4KB**; you need to use **envelope encryption** to encrypt more
	- Use the **GenerateDataKey API**
- This is implemented by the **Encryption SDK**, which also works as a CLI tool
	- Supports Java/Python/C/JS
- Allows for **Data Key Caching**
	- Reuse data keys; helps with reducing calls to KMS, but also less security
	- Use **LocalCryptoMaterialsCache**

### KMS Request Quotas

- If you call the KMS API too much, you will get a **ThrottlingException**
	- Use exponential backoff
	- If this is from **GenerateDataKey**, you should use **DEK Caching**
	- Request for a quote increase **through API/AWS support**

### S3 Bucket Key for SSE-KMS Encryption

- Reduce KMS API calls by 99% by using **S3 Bucket Key** to generate data keys for objects in the bucket
	- Less KMS CloudTrail events

## CloudHSM

- **CloudHSM** provides **dedicated hardware security models** in the cloud; if you want to manage your own keys entirely, use this
	- Supports symmetric/asymmetric encryption
	- **No free tier**
	- Must use **CloudHSM Client Software**
	- Redshift supports CloudHSM
	- Good for **SSE-C encryption**
- CloudHSM clusters have high availability

### Parameter Policies

- Can assign a **TTL** to a parameter to force update/deletion of passwords and stuff

## AWS Secrets Manager

- **Secrets Manager** is used to store secrets
	- Can force **rotation** of secrets every X days
	- Automate secret generation (using Lambda)
	- Integrates with **Amazon RDS**
- Secrets are encrypted using KMS
- Mostly meant for RDS integration 

### Multi-Region Secrets

- Replicate Secrets across multiple AWS regions 
- Secrets Manager keeps replicas in sync w/ primary secret
	- Can **promote** read replica secret to standalone secret

### SSM Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager

- Secrets Manager (lot of money) 
	- **Automatic rotation** of secrets w/ Lambda
	- Lambda function is provided for RDS/Redshift/DocumentDB
	- **Mandatory KMS encryption**
	- Can integrate w/ CloudFormation
- SSM Parameter Store (cheaper)
	- Simple API 
	- **No secret rotation**
	- **Optional** KMS encryption
	- Can integrate w/ CloudFormation
	- Can pull a Secrets Manager secret using Parameter Store API 

## CloudFormation Stuff

- **Dynamic References** allow you to reference external values in SSM PS or Secrets Manager
	- CloudFormation retrieves the value of specified reference during CRUD ops 
- Supports **ssm**, **ssm-secure**, and **secretsmanager**
- **ManageMasterUserPassword** creates admin secret implicitly 
	- RDS, Aurora will manage secret in Secrets Manager and its rotation

## CloudWatch Logs 

- You can encrypt CloudWatch logs with KMS keys
	- Encryption is enabled at the log group level by **associating CMK w/ log group**
	- You **cannot associate a CMK** w/ a log group using CloudWatch console
- **associate-kms-key**: if the log group already exists
- **create-log-group**: if the log group doesn't exist yet

## CodeBuild Security

- To access resources in VPC, **specify VPC config** for CodeBuild
	- Secrets in CodeBuild
	- Don't store them as plaintext in env variables 
- Instead:
	- `env` can reference parameter store parameter
	- `env` can reference secrets manager secrets

## AWS Nitro Enclaves

- **Nitro Enclaves** allow you to process highly sensitive data in an isolated compute environment
	- **PII**, **healthcare**, **financial**
- **Fully isolated** VMs
- Helps reduce attack surface for sensitive apps
