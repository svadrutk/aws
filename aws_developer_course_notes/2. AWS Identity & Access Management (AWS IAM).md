## Users & Groups

![[Pasted image 20240804191720.png]]

* Users are people within an organization and can belong to multiple groups or no groups 
* Groups only contain users and ***cannot contain other groups***
## Permissions 

- [[#Users & Groups]] can be assigned JSON documents called **policies**, which define permissions for users.
	- **Least privilege principle**: Don't give a user more permissions than they need 
### Example Policy

```json
{ 
	"Version": "2012-10-17", // policy language version 
	"Id": "S3-Account-Permissions", // OPTIONAL: identifier for the                                        // policy
	"Statement": [ 
		{   
			"Sid": "1", // OPTIONAL: 
			"Effect": "Allow", // whether the statement 
							   // allows/denies access
			"Action": "ec2:Describe*", // list of actions
			"Resource": "*" // list of resources to which the action
							// applies to
		}, 
		{ 
			"Effect": "Allow", 
			"Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*", 
			"Resource": "*" 
		}, 
		{ 
			"Effect": "Allow", 
			"Action": [ 
						"cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
						"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
						"cloudwatch:Describe*" 
				], 
			"Resource": "*" } 
	] 
}
```

### Policy Structure

- **Version**: Policy language version 
- **Id**: Identifier for policy (*optional*)
- **Statement**: One or more individual statements
	* **Sid**: Identifier for statement (*optional*)
	* **Effect**: Allow/deny access 
	* **Principal**: Account/user/role that this policy applies to
	* **Action**: List of actions that effect applies to 
	* **Resource**: List of resources that actions apply to 
	* **Condition**: Conditions to use policy

## IAM Security 

* You can set up a **password policy** to make sure that there's higher security for your account
	* Minimum password length
	* Require specific character types
	* Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
	* Require users to change their password after some time 
	* Prevent password re-use
* You can use **MFA** (multi-factor authentication) in AWS
	* Virtual MFA device (Okta Verify, Duo) 
	* Physical security key (U2F)
* Users can access AWS through the **Management Console** (password + MFA), **CLI** (access keys), and **SDK** (access keys).
* **Access Keys** are generated through the AWS console 
	* Made up of an Access Key ID (username) and a secret access key (password)
	* *NEVER SHARE THIS.*
* **AWS CLI**: CLI for AWS services 
	* Direct access to services' public APIs 
	* Open-source
	* Alternative to using AWS Management Console 
* **AWS SDK**: Software Development Kit for AWS 
	* Language-specific APIs 
	* Use AWS services embedded in your code
		* Supports
			* SDKS `JS, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go`
			* Mobile SDKs `Android, iOS`
			* IoT Device SDKs `Embedded C, Arduino`
* We can assign [[#Permissions|permissions]] to the services with **IAM Roles**
* There are security tools for this **auditing**: 
	* **IAM Credentials Report (account-level)**: Lists credentials of users
	* **IAM Access Advisor (user-level)**: Shows permissions granted to a user and their timestamps

* IAM has a **shared responsibility model**. 
	* AWS takes care of: 
		* Infrastructure
		* Configuration + vulnerability analysis
		* Compliance validation
	* Users are in charge of:
		* Role management (users, groups, policy management, monitoring)
		* MFA (for added security)
		* Key rotation (for added security)
		* Using IAM tools to apply the perms they want
		* Analyzing access patterns
