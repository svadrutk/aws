- **Traditional Architecture** usually uses RDBMS Databases
	- Uses SQL 
	- Strong requirements about data modeling
	- Can do query joins/aggregations/other complex computations
	- Vertical/horizontal scaling
- **NoSQL Databases** are **non-relational** and **distributed**
	- MongoDB, DynamoDB
	- Do **not support query joins**
	- All the data for a query is **present in one row**
	- **Cannot** do aggregations like **SUM, AVG**
	- Able to scale **horizontally**
## DynamoDB

- Amazon **DynamoDB** is a serverless NoSQL Database
	- Scales to really big workloads because it can be **distributed**
	- Millions of requests/s, trillions of rows, 100s of TBs of storage
	- **Fast** and **consistent** performance (low latency)
	- Integrated with **IAM**
	- Allows for [[19. AWS Lambda#Event Source Mapping|event driven programming]] with **DynamoDB Streams**
	- Low cost, auto-scaling
	- **Standard** and **Infrequent Access** Table Classes
- DynamoDB is made of **Tables**
	- Each table has a **primary key** that identifies it (decided at creation time)
		- Can be a **partition key (HASH)** that must be unique for each item and **diverse** so that the data is distributed
		- Can be a **partition + sort key (HASH + RANGE)** where data is grouped by partition key
	- Each table can have **infinite rows**
	- Each item (row) has **attributes**
		- These can be added over time or can be null 
	- **Max size** of each item is **400KB**
	- Supports **scalar** (String, Number, Binary, Boolean), **document** (List, Map) and **set types** (String/Number/Binary sets)
- DynamoDB also supports **read/write capacity modes**
	- **Provisioned Mode**: specify r/w per second; requires planning capacity beforehand
		- Pay for **provisioned** r/w units
		- **RCU**: Throughput for reads, both **eventually consistent reads** (**2** reads per second for **4KB** object) and **strongly consistent reads** (**1** read per second for **4KB** object)
			- **10 SCRs** per second with **4KB** item is **10 RCUs**
			- **16 ECRs** per second with **12KB** item is **24 RCUs** since 
			- **10 SCRs** per second with **6KB** item is **20 RCUs**
		- **WCU**: Throughput for writes; one write per second for an item up to 1KB
			- **10** items per second with each item being **2KB** would be **20 WCUs**
			- **6** items per second with each item being **4.5KB** would be **30 WCUs** 
			- **120** items per minute with each item being **2KB** would be **4 WCUs**
		- **RCUs** and **WCUs** are **independent** and can be **scaled independently of each other**
		- Can setup **autoscaling** of throughput to meet demand
		- Throughput can be exceeded **temporarily** with **burst capacity**
			- If this gets consumed you will get a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`
			- Do exponential backoff after
	- **On-Demand Mode**: r/w automatically scale with workloads
		- No capacity planning
		- Unlimited WCU/WRU
		- Pay for what you **use**, **more expensive (2.5x)**
		- Good for **unknown workloads** and **unpredictable traffic**
	- Can switch between modes **every 24 hours**
## Partitions + Throttling

- Data is stored in **partitions** in the database based on **partition keys**
	- To calculate partitions by **capacity** and **size**, use these equations. The **true size** is the **bigger value** from these equations: 

$$\text{partitions}_{capacity} = \frac{RCU}{3000} + \frac{WCU}{1000}$$
$$\text{partitions}_{size} = \frac{\text{Total Size}}{10GB}$$
- Throttling is usually caused by **hot keys** (one partition key being read too much), **hot partitions**, and **very big items**
	- You can solve these issues using **exponential backoff**, **distributing partition keys**, and using **DynamoDB accelerator** if the RCUs are the issue

## Writing Data

- `PutItem`: Creates a new item/replaces an item with the same primary key 
	- Consumes **WCUs**
- `UpdateItem`: Updates an item's attributes or adds an item if it doesn't exist
	- Can be used for **atomic counters** (numeric attribute that is incremented)
- `ConditionalWrites`: Accepts a write/update/delete based on conditions, otherwise return error
	- Helps with concurrent access
	- No performance impact
	- `attribute_exists/attribute_not_exists`: If the attribute exists or not
	- `attribute_type`: Type of attribute
	- `contains`: What item contains
	- `begins_with`
	- `size`: String length
- `DeleteItem`: Delete item (can do conditionally)
- `DeleteTable`: Delete table

## Reading Data

- `GetItem`: Read item based on a **primary key**
	- Default is an **eventually consistent read**
	- `ProjectionExpression` is used to retrieve only certain attributes
- Query returns items based on:
	- `KeyConditionExpression`: Partition (required) + Sort key value (optional)
	- `FilterExpression`: Additional filtering after query operations
		- Use **only with non-key attrs**
	- Returns **number of items specified in Limit** OR **<=1MB of data**
	- Can use **pagination**
	- Can query a **table**, a **Local Secondary Index**, or a **Global Secondary Index**
- Scans are another **inefficient** method for reading; use it for **big tables**
	- Scans **entire table** then **filters out data**
	- Returns **<=1MB** of data
	- Consumes **a lot of RCUs**
	- Use **Limit** to reduce the size of result
	- Use **Parallel Scan** to improve performance
		- Multiple workers scan different parts of table
		- Increases **throughput/RCU**
	- Can use `ProjectionExpression` and `FilterExpression`
## Batch Operations

- Can **reduce API calls** to **save latency**
- Operations are done **in parallel**
- `BatchWriteItem`: Write <=25 operations in one call
	- <16MB of data (400KB/item)
	- **Cannot update items**
	- Will return **UnprocessedItems** for failed operations -> Exponential Backoff, add WCU
- `BatchGetItem`: Read <=100 items (<=16MB) from tables
	- Items are retrieved **in parallel**
	- Will returned **UnprocessedKeys** for failed operations -> Exponential Backoff, add WCU

## PartiQL

- DynamoDB uses **PartiQL**, an SQL-compatible language
	- Allows **selection/insertion/updates/deleting** with SQL 
	- Run queries across multiple tables
- Can run these from AWS Management Console, NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB, APIs, CLI, SDK
- Supports **INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE**
	- + Batch operations

## Local Secondary Index (LSI)

- Provides an **alternative sort key** for your table
	- Consists of either String/Number/Binary
- <=5 LSIs per table
- Must be **defined at table creation** time
- **Attribute Projections** -- specify what attributes this LSI contains (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)

## Global Secondary Index (GSI) 

- Provides an **alternative primary key** from the table
- Speeds up queries on **non-key attributes**
- **Attribute Projections** -- specify what attributes this GSI contains (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)
- Must provision RCUs & WCUs for index 
- Can be **added/modified** after table creation

## Index and Throttling 

- Global Secondary Index (GSI): 
	- If writes are **throttled** here, **main table is throttled**
	- **Choose GSI partition key carefully**
	- Assign **WCU capacity carefully**
- Local Secondary Index (LSI): 
	- Uses **WCUs, RCUs** of main table
	- Irrelevant

## Optimistic Locking

- **Optimistic Locking** is a strategy to ensure an item has not changed before updating/deletions
	- Attribute that acts as **version number**

## DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

- **DAX** is an **in-memory cache** for DynamoDB
	- Microsecond latency for cached reads/queries
	- Doesn't require logic modifications
	- Solves **Hot Key problem**
	- Default is **5m TTL**
	- <=10 nodes in cluster
	- **Multi-AZ** (>=3 nodes recommended)
	- Secure

## DynamoDB Streams

- **DynamoDB Streams** are ordered streams of item-level modifications in a table
	- Can be sent to Kinesis Data Streams/Kinesis Client Library, read by Lambda functions
- Retains data for **<=1d**
- Good for real-time reactions, analytics, inserting into derivative tables, inserting into OpenSearch service, implementing cross-region replication
- Can **choose information to be written to stream**
	- **KEYS_ONLY**: Only key attributes
	- **NEW_IMAGE**: Entire item after modification
	- **OLD_IMAGE**: Entire item before modification
	- **NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES**: Both new and old images of item
- DynamoDB Streams are made of **shards**
	- Shards are **automated by AWS**
- You can define an [[19. AWS Lambda#Event Source Mapping|Event Source Mapping]] to read from DynamoDB streams with Lambda
	- Ensure **correct IAM perms**
	- Lambda function is **invoked synchronously**

## TTL 

- DynamoDB automatically **deletes items after an expiry timestamp**
	- Does **not consume WCUs**
	- TTL attribute must be a **Number** data type
- Expired items are deleted **<=2d after expiration date**
- Deleted from **LSIs and GSIs**
- Delete operations **show up in streams**

## CLI 

- **--projection-expression**: One or more attributes 
- **--filter-expression**: Filter items before returned to you
- **--page-size**: Change size of each page
- **--max-items**: Max number of items to show in CLI 
- **--starting-token**: Specify the last NextToken to retrieve the next set of items

## Transactions

- **Transactions** are operations to multiple items across table(s) that are **all-or-nothing**
	- Provides **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability**
- **Read Modes** -- Eventual Consistency, Strong Consistency, Transactional
- **Write Modes** -- Standard, Transactional
- **Consumes 2x WCUs, RCUs**
	- 2 operations per item
- Either `TransactGetItems` or `TransactWriteItems`

### Capacity Computations (**IMPORTANT**)

- **3** Transactional writes per second with item size **5KB** is **30 WCUs** 
- **5** Transactional reads per second with item size **5KB** is **20 RCUs**

## Session State Cache

- DynamoDB is commonly used to **store session states**
	- vs. Elasticache (**in-memory**)
	- vs. EFS (**attached to EC2 instances as network drive**)
	- vs. EBS, Instance Store (**only for local caching**)
	- vs. S3 (**higher latency, not good for smaller objects**)

## Write Sharding

- **Write sharding** is a strategy to **better distribute** items evenly across partitions
	- Adds **suffix** to partition key value
		- Random suffix, calculated suffix

## DynamoDB Operations

- **Table Cleanup**: Can either **Scan + DeleteItem** (slow, expensive) or **Drop Table + Recreate Table** (fast, efficient, cheap)
- **Copying Table**: Use **AWS Data Pipeline**, **Backup and restore into new table** (slow), **Scan + PutItem or BatchWriteItem** (write own code)

## Security + Other Features

- Can use **VPC Endpoints**, **IAM Roles** and **KMS** for security
- Can **Backup and Restore** with no performance impact
- DynamoDB is highly available 
- Can **test locally** without Internet

## Fine-Grained Access Control

- Can use **Web Identity Federation** or **Cognito Identity Pools** for more fine-grained access
