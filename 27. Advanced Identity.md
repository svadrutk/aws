## AWS STS (Security Token Service)

- **STS** grants **temp** access to AWS resources
	- **AssumeRole**: Assume roles within your account/cross-account
	- **AssumeRoleWithSAML**: Same thing but authenticated w/ SAML 
	- **AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity (not recommended)**: Returns credentials for users logged in with an identity provider; **use Cognito Identity Pools instead** 
	- **GetSessionToken**: Used for MFA; returns access ID, secret key, session token, expiration date
		- Must enable `aws:MutliFactorAuthPresent: true`
	- **GetFederationToken**: Used for federated users
	- **GetCallerIdentity**: Get details about IAM user/role in API call
	- **DecodeAuthorizationMessage**: Decode error message when API is denied
- To use STS: 
	1. Define IAM role within account/cross-account
	2. Define principals that can access role
	3. Use STS to get credentials and "impersonate" role you have access to 
	4. Credentials are valid **15m-1h**

## Policy Evaluation 

- The authorization model evaluates policies using 3 conditions: 
	1. If DENY, end decision and DENY
	2. If ALLOW, end decision with ALLOW
	3. Else DENY
- Permissions of an IAM principal on a bucket are evaluated with the **union of IAM and bucket policies**
	- IAM w/ RW access + no S3 bucket policy = R/W access
	- IAM w/ RW access + DENY bucket policy = no access
	- IAM + ALLOW bucket policy = R/W access
	- IAM w/o RW access + ALLOW bucket policy = no access
	- **Basically prefer deny unless all policies are allow**

## Inline vs Managed Policies


| Inline                                    | Managed                     | Customer Managed              |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1:1 relationship between policy/principal | Maintained by AWS           | Best practice, reusable       |
| If principal is deleted, so is policy     | Good for power users/admins | Version controlled + rollback |
|                                           | Updated regularly           |                               |

## Passing Roles

- Use the IAM permission **iam:PassRole** to pass a role to the service
- Roles can **only** be passed onto what their **trust** allows (dictated by a **trust policy**)

## Directory stuff

- **Microsoft Active Directory (AD)** is a database of objects; user accounts, computers, printers, etc. 
	- Has centralized security management, create account, assign perms
	- Objects are organized in **trees**; group of trees is a **forest**
- **AWS Managed Microsoft AD** allows you to create your own AD in AWS and managed users locally; supports MFA
	- Establish **trust** connections with your own-premise AD
- **AD Connector** is a proxy that can redirect to on-premise AD; supports MFA
- **Simple AD** is an AD-compatible managed directory on AWS; however, it **cannot** be joined with on-premise ADs
