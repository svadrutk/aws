- **Docker** is a platform for **deploying apps**
	- These apps are packaged in a **container** where they can be run by **any OS**
- Good for microservices, on-premises apps <--> AWS cloud
- Docker **repositories** store Docker images
	- **Docker Hub** is a public repo that has a ton of base images for many technologies/OS
	- **Amazon ECR** is a public/private repo that is like the AWS version of Docker Hub
		- Store/manage images on AWS
		- Fully integrated with ECS
		- Access is controlled through IAM
		- Supports image vulnerability scanning, versioning, image tags, image lifecycle

- There are several services for container management on AWS: 
	- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**
	- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**
	- **AWS Fargate**
	- **Amazon ECR**

## ECS

There are two main **launch types** for ECS: 
### EC2 Launch Type

- If you use ECS on EC2 instances, you have to **provision** and **maintain** the infrastructure
- **Each instance** must run the **ECS agent** to register it in the cluster
- AWS takes care of starting/stopping containers
- You can use an [[5. High Availability and Scalability#Auto Scaling Group|ASG]] to scale based on CPU Utilization
	- You can also use an **ECS Cluster Capacity Provider** if you want to scale your ASG based on ECS tasks
### Fargate Launch Type

- This is a **serverless way** to launch Docker containers on AWS
- AWS runs **ECS tasks** for you based on the resources you need
	- Scale up = increase tasks

---

- ECS Agent needs [[2. AWS Identity & Access Management (AWS IAM)#^fbef0e|IAM Roles]] to work properly
	- API calls to ECS service
	- Container logs -> CloudWatch
	- Pull Docker images
	- Reference sensitive data
- ECS Tasks also need IAM Roles: 
	- Different roles for different ECS Services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)

### Load Balancer Integrations

- **[[5. High Availability and Scalability#^f60d27|ALBs]]** work fine
	- If ECS task definition has only container port, you get a **Dynamic Host Port Mapping** 
	- You **must allow** the instance [[3. Amazon EC2 Fundamentals#Security Groups|Security Group]] any port from the ALB's security group
- **[[5. High Availability and Scalability#^2e8df9|NLBs]]** should only be used with ECS for high throughput use cases
- **[[5. High Availability and Scalability#^e95f54|CLBs]]** work but not recommended because they don't have Fargate
- Fargate load balancing gives each task a **unique private IP** and you only need to define the container port (because there are no instances involved)

### Data Volumes

- You can mount **EFS** volumes on ECS tasks and make it serverless by mounting it on Fargate
	- Allows tasks running in any AZ to have same data in file system 
- Good if you want persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers
- You can use **EC2 Instance Storage** if you're using instances for ECS, but if you're using Fargate you can use **ephemeral storage**

### Auto Scaling

- You can **automatically increase/decrease** desired number of ECS tasks by using AWS's Application Auto Scaling
	- **Target Tracking**: Scale based on target value for CloudWatch metric
	- **Step Scaling**: Scale based on CloudWatch Alarm
	- **Scheduling Scaling**: Scale based on a date/time
- REMEMBER: ECS Service Auto Scaling is at the **task level** while EC2 Auto Scaling is at the **instance level**
- Fargate Auto Scaling is a lot **easier** to setup because it's serverless

## ECS Rolling Updates

- **Rolling Updates** allow you to update your containers without stopping all your containers and updating them 
	- Can control how many tasks can be started/stopped and in what order

## Task Definitions

- **Task Definitions** are metadata in JSON form for running a Docker container
	- Image Name
	- Port Binding
	- Memory/CPU requirements
	- Env vars
		- Hardcoded (URLs)
		- SSM Parameter Store (sensitive variables; API keys, shared configs)
		- Secrets Manager (sensitive data like passwords)
	- Networking Info

## Task Placement

- **Task Placement** is the process of ECS deciding where to put a task in EC2 instance based on CPU/RAM constraints
	1. Identify which instances satisfy CPU/Memory/Port reqs
	2. Identify which instance satisfy **Task Placement Constraints**
	3. Identify which instances satisfy **Task Placement Strategies**
- **Task Placement Strategies**
	- **Binpack**: Tasks are placed on least available amount of CPU/Memory
		- minimizes instance use
	- **Random**: Tasks are placed randomly
	- **Spread**: Tasks are placed evenly based on specified value
	- You can also **mix these together**
- **Task Placement Constraints** limit what tasks can be placed on 
	- **distinctInstance**: Tasks are placed on different instance
	- **memberOf**: Tasks are placed on instances that satisfy a specified expression

## AWS CLI 

- **Login Command**: `aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com`
- **Docker Push**: `docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.comm/demo:latest`
- **Docker Pull**: `docker pull aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/demo:latest`

## AWS Copilot

- **Copilot** is a CLI tool to build/release/operate containerized apps
- Run apps on AppRunner/ECS/Fargate
- Helps you focus on apps instead of infrastructure
- Provisions all required infrastructure for containerized apps
- Automated deployments
- Deploy to multiple environments
- Troubleshooting/logs/health status

## Amazon EKS

- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** is like ECS but for Kubernetes clusters
	- Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment/scaling/management of containerized apps
- EKS **supports EC2** if you want to deploy worker nodes or use Fargate
- Kubernetes can be **used in any cloud**
- You have to deploy **1 EKS cluster/region**
- Collect logs/metrics using **CloudWatch Container Insights**

### Node Types

- **Managed Node Groups** create/manage EC2 instances for you 
	- **Node** is an instance part of an ASG managed by EKS
	- Supports **On-Demand/Spot Instances**
- **Self-Managed Nodes** are created by you and registered to the EKS cluster/managed by an ASG
	- Can use AMIs for this
	- Supports **On-Demand/Spot Instances**
- **AWS Fargate** is serverless, so no maintenance is required

### Data Volumes

- You need to use a **StorageClass manifest** on EKS cluster
	- Uses a **Container Storage Interface (CSI)** driver
- Supports EBS, EFS, FSx for Lustre, FSx for NetApp ONTAP
