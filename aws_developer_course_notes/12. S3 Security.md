## Object Encryption 

- Objects can be encrypted with **4** methods: 
### SSE-S3

- Uses keys handled/managed/owned **by AWS**
	- Encrypted server-side
- Uses **AES-256** encryption 
	- Requires setting header **"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"**
- **Enabled by default**

### SSE-KMS

- Uses keys handled by **AWS KMS** (Key Management Service)
	- KMS allows for **user control**
- Requires setting header **"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"**

### SSE-C

- Uses keys **fully managed by customer**
	- S3 **does not store** encryption key 
- Uses **HTTPS**
	- Encryption key must be provided in headers for every request

### Client-Side Encryption 

- Uses client libraries like **S3 Client-Side Encryption Library**
	- Clients encrypt/decrypt data themselves 
- Customer **fully manages** keys and encryption cycle

### Encryption in Transit (SSL/TLS)

- What HTTPS uses
	- Mostly used **by default**
- If you want to force encryption in transit, you should write a bucket policy like: 

```
"Condition": {
	"Bool": {
		"aws:SecureTransport": "false"
	}
}
```

## CORS 

- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
	- **Origin**: protocol + domain + port
- CORS acts as a mechanism to **allow requests** to **other origins** while visiting **same origin**
	- SAME ORIGIN: .http://example.com/app1 & .http://example.com/app2
	- DIFFERENT ORIGINS: .http://www.example.com & http://other.example.com
		- Requests **won't be fulfilled** unless origin allows for the requests using CORS headers

- **POPULAR EXAM QUESTION**: If a client makes a **cross-origin request** on S3 bucket, we need to enable **correct CORS headers**

## MFA Delete 

- **MFA** forces users to generate code on device before important operations
	- Required for **permanent deletion**, **suspending versioning**
	- Not required for **enabling versioning**, **listing deleted versions**
- Only **root account** can enable/disable MFA delete

## S3 Access Logs

- Requests made to S3 will be logged into other S3 bucket
	- **Must be in same AWS region**
	- Careful not to set logging bucket to monitored bucket because it will start logging the logs

## Pre-Signed URLs

- Generates **pre-signed URLs** using S3 Console/CLI/SDK
	- Console takes 1min-720mins
	- CLI allows configuration of expiration with `--expires-in` parameter in seconds
- Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the user that generated URL for GET/PUT
	- Allows for **only logged-in users** to download premium video from S3 bucket
	- Allows a **dynamic list of users** to download files 
	- Temporary allowance of a user to upload a file

## Access Points

- **Access Points**: allows simpler security management for S3 buckets
	- Has a **DNS Name** (Internet Origin)
	- Has an **access point policy** to manage security at scale
- Can define access point to **only be accessible from VPC**
	- VPC Endpoint <--> Access Point
- VPC Endpoint Policy **must allow access** to **target bucket AND access point**

## S3 Object Lambda 

- Use AWS Lambda Function to **change object** before its retrieved by the caller 
	- Good for redacting **personally identifiable info**
