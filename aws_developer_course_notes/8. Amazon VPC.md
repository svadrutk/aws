- Not that important, 1-2 questions on exam 
## VPC & Subnets

- **VPC**: Private network (region scope)
- **Subnets**: Partitions of a VPC (AZ scope) ^b216ae
	- **Public Subnet**: Accessible from internet
	- **Private Subnet**: Not accessible from internet
	- Access is designated by **Route Tables**

## Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways

- **Internet Gateways**: Helps VPC connect to internet
	- Public Subnets **have a route** to internet gateway 
- **NAT Gateways (AWS Managed)** and **NAT Instances (self-managed)** allow private subnets access to internet while being private

## Network ACL & Security Groups 

- **NACL (Network ACL)**: Firewall for VPCs
	- Has both **Allow** and **Deny** rules 
		- **Only include IPs**
	- Attached at [[#^b216ae|subnet]] level
- **[[3. Amazon EC2 Fundamentals#Security Groups|Security Groups]]** are a firewall for EC2 instances
	- **Only** has **Allow** rules

## VPC Flow Logs

- **Flow Logs** capture traffic going into your interface
	- Monitors connectivity between: 
		- Subnets <--> Internet
		- Subnets <--> Subnets
		- Internet <--> Subnets
	- Captures network info from ELB, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc. 
- Flow logs can be transferred to S3/CloudWatch/etc.

## VPC Peering

- **Peering** is the process of connecting two VPCs using AWS's network 
	- Can make them behave as if they are **in same network** 
	- **Cannot have overlapping IP address range** to work
	- Must be established for **all VPCs**

## VPC Endpoints

- **Only used within VPC**
- Allow connection to AWS services using private network 
	- Enhanced security/lower latency 
- Uses **S3** and **DynamoDB**

## Site to Site VPN + Direct Connect

- **Site to Site VPN**: Connects VPN to AWS
	- Automatically encrypted
	- Goes over public internet
- **Direct Connect (DX)**: Physical connection between on-premises and AWS
	- **Most private** connection
	- Goes over a private network
	- Takes a **long time to establish**
