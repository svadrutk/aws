- **Serverless** means that developers don't have to **manage servers**
	- Just deploy code/functions
- Serverless was initially **FaaS (Function as a Service)**
- Serverless services in AWS include: 
	- AWS Lambda
	- DynamoDB
	- AWS Cognito
	- AWS API Gateway
	- S3 
	- AWS SNS + SQS
	- AWS Kinesis Data Firehose
	- Aurora Serverless
	- Step Functions
	- Fargate

**AWS Lambda vs. EC2**

| EC2                        | Lambda                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Virtual servers in cloud   | Virtual **functions** |
| Limited by RAM/CPU         | **Short executions**  |
| Always running             | Runs **on-demand**    |
| Have to intervene to scale | **Automated** scaling |

- **Benefits of Lambda**:
	- Easy pricing ($/request + compute time)
	- Free tier includes **1M requests** and **400K GBS** of compute time
	- Integrate with **all services**
	- Integrated with **many programming languages**
		- NodeJS, Python, Java, C#, Ruby, Custom Runtime APIs
		- Lambda Container Images
	- Easy monitoring with [[18. AWS Monitoring, Troubleshooting, Audit#CloudWatch|Cloudwatch]] 
	- Can get more resources per function 
	- More RAM = more CPU/network
## Pricing

- **Pay Per Call**: $0.20/1M requests
- **Pay Per Duration**: $1/600K GB
	- Free 400K GB-seconds
- **VERY CHEAP!**
---
- **Synchronous Invocations** are the processes where an app calls Lambda and waits for it to return a value before proceeding.
	- Services that use this include ELB, API Gateway, Cloudfront, S3 Batch, Cognito, Step Functions, Amazon Lex, Alexa, and Kinesis Data Firehose

## ALB Integration 

- You can use Lambda as an **HTTPS Endpoint** by registering it in a **target group** and connecting it to an Application Load Balancer/API Gateway
![[Pasted image 20241022195351.png]]
- ALB can support **multi header values**

HTTP: `.http://example.com/path?name=foo&name=bar`
JSON: `"queryStringParameters": {"name":{"foo, bar"}}
`
## Asynchronous Invocations

- **Asynchronous Events** are used for services like S3, SNS, and CloudWatch events.
	- Events are placed in an **event queue**
	- Lambda retries on errors **3 times** using exponential backoff (1m after 1st attempt, 2m after 2nd, etc.)
	- Ensure that the processing is **idempotent** (can be applied multiple times without changing result)
	- You can define a **DLQ** (SNS/SQS) for failed processing if you want
		- Ensure correct **IAM perms**
- Asynchronous Invocations help **speed up processing**
- Services that use Asynchronous Invocations include: 
	- S3
	- SNS
	- CloudWatch Events/EventBridge
	- CodeCommit
	- CodePipeline
	- CloudWatch Logs
	- Simple Email Service
	- CloudFormation
	- Config
	- IoT
	- IoT Events

## S3 Event Notifications

- Remember that if two writes are made to a single non-versioned object, there may only be **one event notification sent**
	- **Enable versioning** if you want an event notification for every successful write

## Event Source Mapping 

- **Event Source Mapping** is a Lambda resource that reads items from stream/queues and invokes a function with batches of records
	- Used with Kinesis Data Streams, SQS + SQS FIFO, DynamoDB streams
	- **NOT SNS**
- For Kinesis, the ESM creates an **iterator** for each [[17. AWS Integration & Messaging#^befd5b|shard]] and processes items in order
- Starts with **new items** based on beginning/timestamp
- Processed items are **not removed from stream**
- If there is **low traffic**, you should use the **batch window** to accumulate records before processing
- You can process **<=10 batches/shard**

### Error Handling

- If function returns an error, **entire batch is reprocessed** or items in batch expire
	- Processing for affected shard is paused until error is solved (for **in-order processing**)
- You can **configure** the ESM to 
	- Discard old events
	- Restrict retries
	- Split batch on error
- Discarded events can go to a **Destination**

### SQS + SQS FIFO 

- You can specify **batch size (1-10 messages)** for polling SQS 
- Set queue visibility timeout to **6x** Lambda timeout
- You can use a **DLQ** but you should set it up on the SQS queue, **not Lambda** (REMEMBER: DLQ for Lambda is **only for async invocations**)
	- You can also use a **Lambda destination** for failures
### Queues + Lambda

- Lambda also supports in-order processing for **FIFO** queues and can **scale up** to the # of activate message groups 
- Lambda **scales up** to process **standard queues** ASAP 
- After **error**, batches are returned to the queue as **individual items** and will be processed in a **different grouping**
- Lambda **deletes** items from queue after successful processing 
	- For **streams**, processed items aren't removed
	- Source queue can also **send items to DLQ** if they can't be processed

### Scaling

- **Kinesis/DynamoDB Streams**: 1 Lambda invocation per shard
	- You can use parallelization so <= 10 batches can be processed per shard at the same time
- **SQS Standard**: +60 instances per minute 
	- <=1K messages processed simultaneously
- **SQS FIFO**: Messages with same GroupID will be processed in order
	- Lambda function scales to # of active message groups

## Event + Context Objects

- **Event Object**: JSON-formatted document that has data for function to process 
	- Contains information from service
	- Lambda runtime converts event -> object
- **Context Object**: Provides methods/properties that have information about invocation/function/runtime environment (**metadata about function**)
	- Passed to function by Lambda @ runtime

## Destinations

- **Destinations** are a Lambda feature that allows you to route **async invocation** outputs -> AWS service
	- SQS/SNS/Lambda/EventBridge bus

## Lambda Execution Role

- **Lambda Execution Role** grants Lambda function permissions to other AWS services/resources
	- **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole** -- Upload Logs to CloudWatch
	- **AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole** -- Read from Kinesis
	- etc.
- When you use an **event source mapping**, Lambda uses the **execution role** to read data
- Create **1 Lambda Execution Role per function**

## Lambda Resource Based Policies

- Similar to S3 [[9. Amazon S3 Introduction#Bucket Policies|Bucket Policies]]
- IAM account can access Lambda if: 
	- Principal IAM allows it
	- Resource-based policy allows it

## Environment Variable

- Lambda **Environment Variables** are key-val pairs in "String" form 
	- Use this to adjust function behavior without changing code
	- Good for **storing secrets**

## Logging + Monitoring

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Lambda execution logs are stored here
	- Ensure correct IAM perms 
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Lambda metrics are displayed in here
	- Invocations/Durations/Concurrent Executions
	- Error Count/Success Rate/Throttles
	- Async Delivery Failures
	- Iterator Age 
- **X-Ray**: Must enable in Lambda configuration; runs X-Ray Daemon for you 
	- Ensure correct IAM Role (**AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess**)
	- Environment Variables to communicate with X-Ray are `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` (tracing header), `AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING` (`LOG_ERROR`), `AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS` (X-Ray Daemon IP)

## CloudFront Usage

- **Edge Functions** are functions attached to CloudFront distributions that run close to your users to minimize latency 
	- You can use **CloudFront Functions** or **Lambda@Edge**
- You can use edge functions for many cases: 
	- Website security/privacy
	- Dynamic Web Apps
	- SEO 
	- Bot Mitigation
	- Image Transformation in Real-Time
	- A/B Testing
	- User authentication/authorization
	- User Prioritization
	- User Tracking/Analytics
- **CloudFront Functions**: 
	- Lightweight functions in **JS** 
	- Good for **latency-sensitive, high-scale** CDN customizations
	- Sub-ms startup times
	- Native to CloudFront
	- Used to change **viewer requests** and **viewer responses**
	- Good for **simple processes**
- **Lambda@Edge**: 
	- Lambda functions written in **NodeJS/Python**
	- Scales to 1000 requests/s
	- Used to change **viewer/origin requests and responses**
	- You can make functions in one AWS region and CloudFront will replicate
	- Good for **more complex processes**


| CloudFront Functions                 | Lambda@Edge                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Cache key Normalization              | Longer execution time               |
| Header manipulation                  | Adjustable CPU/Memory               |
| URL rewrites/redirects               | Code depends on 3rd party libraries |
| Request authentication/authorization | Network access                      |
|                                      | File system access                  |
## Lambda w/ VPC

- Lambda functions are by **default** launched **outside your VPC** 
	- Must define VPC ID/Subnets/Security Groups
	- Lambda will then create an **ENI** (Elastic Network Interface) in subnets
	- `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole`
- Lambdas in VPCs by default **do not have internet access**
	- You must have a **NAT Gateway** / Instance 
	- You can use **VPC Endpoints** to privately access AWS Services without a NAT

## Function Configuration

- Can configure **RAM** from **128MB-10GB** in **1MB increments**
	- More RAM = More vCPU
	- 1792 MB = 1 full vCPU
- If your application is **computation heavy**, **increase RAM**
- Timeout is by **default 3s**, can go **up to 900s**

## Execution Context

- **Execution Context** is a **temp runtime env** that loads dependencies
	- Database connections/HTTP Clients/SDK clients
- Execution Context is **active for a bit** in case another function invocation happens
	- Function can **reuse** context and **save time** initializing
- Execution context **includes /tmp dir**

### /tmp Directory

- The **/tmp** directory is used for activities like downloading a big file or needing disk space to perform operations
	- Max size is **10GB**
	- Directory content is maintained where the execution context is frozen 
	- If you want more permanent storage, **use S3**
	- Use **KMS Data Keys** to encrypt content on /tmp
## Layers

- Lambda **layers** are used to share data **across multiple functions**
	- Custom runtimes, etc.
## File Systems Mounting

- Lambda can leverage **EFS Access Points** to mount EFS filesystems to local dir during initialization
	- Only works **if they're running in VPC**
	- Ensure that your use case meets EFS **connection limits** (1 function instance = 1 connection) and **connection burst limits**
## Concurrency + Throttling

- <= 1K concurrent executions
	- Can set **function-specific limits**
- A **throttle** will occur if an invocation occurs above limit
	- Synchronous invocation = `return ThrottleError`
	- Async invocation = retry then DLQ
		- Retries for up to **6 hours** w/ **exponential backoff**
- Open a **support ticket** if you want a **higher limit**
## Cold Starts + Provisioned Concurrency 

- **Cold Start**: Code is loaded on **new instance** and **init is run**
	- If `init` is large, this takes a long time
	- **First** request has **higher latency** than rest
- **Provisioned Concurrency**: Concurrency is allocated before invocation
	- All invocations have **low latency**
	- Application Auto Scaling can manage concurrency
## Dependencies

- Packages should be **installed alongside code and zipped**
	- NodeJS -> `npm` + `node_modules` dir
	- Python -> `pip --target options`
	- Java -> `.jar` files
- If **<=50MB**, upload to Lambda
	- Else, **upload to S3**
- Native libraries need to be **compiled on Amazon Linux**
- **AWS SDK** comes bundled with every function

## Cloudformation

- **Inline Functions** in CloudFormation are very simple to include
	- Use `Code.ZipFile` property
	- **You cannot include dependencies with this type of function**
- **S3 Functions**
	- Lambda **`zip`** is stored in S3
	- Refer to S3 location in CloudFormation code
		- `S3Bucket`
		- `S3Key` -- path to zip 
		- `S3ObjectVersion` if versioned
	- CloudFormation **will not update** your function if these properties are not updated

## Containers

- You can use **ECR** to deploy Lambda functions as container images
	- <=10G
	- Can pack complex/large dependencies
	- Base images available for **Python, NodeJS, Java, .NET, Go, Ruby**
	- Can create **own image** but it has to **implement Runtime API**
	- Test using **Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator**
- You should use **AWS-provided Base Image** and **Multi-Stage Builds**
	- Build from **Stable** to **Frequently Changing**
	- Use a **Single Repo** for functions with large layers
- Use **containers** for **large Lambda Functions**

## Versions

- `$LATEST` is version that you work on 
	- Create version from this (**immutable**)
		- V1, V2, etc. 
		- Unique ARN 
		- Each version is accessible
## Aliases

- **Aliases** are **pointers** for function versions
	- `dev` -> v1, `test` -> v2, etc. 
	- Aliases are **mutable**
	- Can assign **weights** to different versions for testing
	- **Aliases cannot reference other aliases**

## CodeDeploy

- CodeDeploy helps **automate traffic shift** for Lambda aliases
	- **Linear**: Shift traffic every $N$ minutes until 100%
	- **Canary**: Shift $X$ percent then 100%
	- **AllAtOnce**: immediate
- You configure this using `AppSpec.yml`
	- **Name** -- name of Lambda function
	- **Alias** -- name of alias
	- **CurrentVersion**, **TargetVersion** -- take a guess

## Function URL

- **Function URL** is a dedicated HTTP(S) endpoint for Lambda
	- `https://<url-id>.lambda-url.<region>.on.aws`
	- Invoke via browser/curl/Postman/etc.
- Access is **only public**
- Supports **Resource-Based Policies** and **CORS configurations**
	- **Resource-Based Policies**: Authorize other accounts/principals
	- **CORS**: If function is called from other domain
- Can be applied to **any function alias** or **$LATEST**
- Use AWS Console/API to create and configure
- You can use **Reserved Concurrency** to throttle
- **Security**:
	- `AuthType NONE` -- allow global access
	- `AuthType AWS_IAM` -- uses IAM to authenticate; Principal must have **lambda:InvokeFUnctionUrl** perm
		- Same Account -- Identity-based Policy **OR** Resource-Based Policy is **ALLOW**
		- Cross Account -- Identity-based Policy **AND** Resource-Based Policy is **ALLOW**

## CodeGuru

- You can use **CodeGuru** to gain insights into **runtime performance**
	- CodeGuru will create a **Profiler Group** for your function
	- Supported for **Java/Python**
	- Activate from **Lambda Console**
	- Lambda adds **CodeGuru profiler layer, Environment variables, AmazonCodeGuruProfilerAgentAccess policy to function**
## Limits to Know

- **Execution**:
	- RAM: 128MB-10G (1MB increments)
	- Function Timeout -- 900s (15m)
	- Environment Variables -- 4KB
	- Disk Capacity in **function container** -- 512MB - 10G
	- <= 1K concurrency executions
- **Deployment**:
	- Function size (zipped): 50MB
	- Function size (unzipped): 250MB
	- Can use /tmp dir to load big files

## Best Practices

- You should **perform heavy-duty work outside handler**
	- Connect to database, initialize SDK, load dependencies, etc. 
- Use **environment variables** for database connection strings, S3, (encrypted w/ KMS) passwords
- **Minimize** deployment package size to runtime necessities
	- Break down function
	- Use Layers
- **Don't use recursive code; NEVER have Lambda function call itself**
