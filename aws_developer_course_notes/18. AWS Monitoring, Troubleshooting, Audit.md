- Monitoring in AWS consists of 3 parts: 
	- **AWS CloudWatch**: Metrics, logs, events, alarms
	- **AWS X-Ray**: **Troubleshoot** app performance, trace microservices
	- **AWS Cloudtrail**: Monitor **API calls**, **audit** changes to resources 
## CloudWatch 

- CloudWatch provides **metrics** for **every service**
	- **Metric**: A variable to monitor that belongs to a **namespace**
		- **Dimension** is an **attribute** of a metric, <=30/metric ^ed12aa
		- Metrics also contain **timestamps**
	- You are able to create **dashboards** of metrics

### EC2 Monitoring

- EC2 instance have metrics every **5 minutes** by default, but you can get metric every **1 minute** if you use **detailed monitoring**
	- Good for faster **scaling response times**

### Custom Metrics 

- You can also define your own **custom metrics** to CloudWatch
	- RAM usage, disk space, # of logged in users
	- This uses the API call **PutMetricData**
- You can use [[#^ed12aa|dimensions]] to segment metrics
- Update time can be 1/5/10/30s ($) or 1m (standard)

### Logs

- **Log Groups**: Logs for an application
- **Log Stream**: Flow of log data from something
- Can send logs to 
	- S3
	- [[17. AWS Integration & Messaging#Kinesis Data Streams|Kinesis Data Streams]] 
	- [[17. AWS Integration & Messaging#Kinesis Firehose|Kinesis Firehose]] 
	- AWS Lambda
	- OpenSearch
- Logs are **encrypted by default**, but you can use KMS if you want to use your own keys
- Logs can come from many sources: 
	- SDK/CloudWatch Logs Agent/CloudWatch Unified Agent
	- Elastic Beanstalk
	- ECS 
	- AWS Lambda
	- VPC Flow Logs
	- API Gateway
	- CloudTrail (based on filter)
	- DNS queries
- **Insights**: You can search and analyze log data in CloudWatch logs
	- Find a specific IP inside a log, etc. 
	- Uses a **query language** that automatically has fields from AWS services and allows you to fetch the fields you want, filter them, etc. 
	- Can query multiple Log Groups cross-account
- **S3 Export**: If you don't need near-real time or real-time, you can export logs to S3 for storage -- this takes <=12h tho 
	- API call is **CreateExportTask**
- There is a pseudo Pub/Sub service for CloudWatch called a **subscription filter**, which can filter which logs are events delivered to what destination
- You can send logs to resources in **different AWS accounts**

### CloudWatch Agents 

- To use CloudWatch logs on EC2, you need to use a **CloudWatch agent** to push the files you want
	- Ensure correct IAM perms 
- **CloudWatch Logs Agent**: Old version of agent, can only send to CloudWatch Logs
- **CloudWatch Unified Agent**: Collects additional system-level metrics 
	- Sends to CloudWatch Logs 
	- Has a centralized configuration with SSM Parameter Store
	- Collects CPU, Disk, RAM, Netstat, Processes, Swap Space metrics

---

- CloudWatch also has a **metric filter** to filter metrics data  ^0de08c
	- Find specific IP inside of a log, count occurrences of "ERROR" in logs, trigger alarms
	- Only filters data **after** filter was created

### Alarms

- **Alarms** are notification triggers for metric 
	- Consists of 3 states
		- OK
		- INSUFFICIENT_DATA
		- ALARM
	- Can refresh 10s, 30s, 60s (multiples)
- Alarms can do many things: 
	- Stop/Terminate/Reboot/Recover EC2
	- Trigger ASG
	- Send notification to SNS (sky's the limit)
- You can also make alarms of alarms, called **composite alarms**
	- Good for reducing noise
	- Uses AND, OR conditions
- Alarms can be created based on [[#^0de08c|metric filters]]
- Test an alarm with this statement: 

```bash
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name "myalarm" --state-value ALARM --state-reason "testing purposes"
```

### Synthetics Canary

- **Synthetics Canary** is a configurable script that helps monitor APIs/URLs/Websites
	- Reproduces what customers do to debug 
	- Checks availability/latency of endpoints
	- Integrates with CloudWatch Alarms
	- Scripts are written in **Nodejs** or **Python**
- Synthetics Canary contains many services: 
	- **Heartbeat Monitor**: Load URL, screenshot
	- **API Canary**: Test REST APIs
	- **Broken Link Checker**: Check all links in URL
	- **Visual Monitoring**: Compare screenshots
	- **Canary Recorder**: Record actions on website -> script
	- **GUI Workflow Builder**: Verifies that actions can be taken

### EventBridge

- EventBridge allows you to do three things: 
	- **Schedule** cronjobs
	- **Make rules** to react to a service doing something
		- User signs in -> SNS Email Topic
	- **Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages**
- EventBridge's **schema registry** generates code to receive events better
	- Schema can be **versioned**
- EventBridge also contains a **resource-based policy** to manage permissions for event buses
	- ALLOW/DENY for an account/region

## AWS X-Ray

- **AWS X-Ray** is used to **debug** in production fast
	- Offers a **visual analysis** of apps
- X-Ray is compatible with **many services**:
	- Lambda
	- Elastic Beanstalk
		- Set an option in the console `aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray:XRayEnabled: true`
		- Ensure correct IAM perms, import SDK
	- ECS
	- ELB
	- API Gateway
	- EC2 Instances
- AWS X-Ray uses **tracing** to follow requests
	- Every component that request goes through adds its own **trace** (w/ optional annotations)
- Can use **IAM** and **KMS** for security
- To enable X-Ray, you should **import the X-Ray SDK**, then **install X-Ray daemon/enable X-Ray Integration**
	- Ensure that each app has IAM rights to write to X-Ray
- X-Ray service computes **segments** (and **sub-segments**) from traces and creates a **visual map**

![[Pasted image 20241021191158.png]]
- Can change **sampling** speed to reduce cost
	- Default is recording **first request/s** (called the **reservoir**) and **5% of additional requests (rate)**
	- Can create **custom sampling rules** that change **reservoir** and **rate**
- X-Ray uses multiple **APIs** to conduct operations
	- **PutTraceSegments**: Segment -> X-Ray
	- **PutTelemetryRecords**: Telemetry -> X-Ray
	- **GetSamplingRules**: guess what this does
	- **GetServiceGraph**: you'll never know what this does
	- **BatchGetTraces**: Gets list of traces by ID (request)
	- **GetTraceSummaries**: Gets list of traces for a specified time frame (optional)
	- **GetTraceGraph**: Graph for specific Trace ID(s)
### Troubleshooting

- If X-Ray doesn't work on EC2
	- Ensure **correct IAM Perms**
	- Ensure instance is **running daemon**
- If X-Ray doesn't work on Lambda: 
	- Ensure **IAM Execution Role**
	- Ensure **import** of X-Ray 
	- Enable **Active Tracing**

## AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

- Custom distribution for OpenTelemetry
	- Standardized set of APIs/libraries/etc. 
	- Collects traces/metrics/metadata from apps and services
	- Send traces/metrics to multiple services
- If you want to **standardize w/ open-source APIs from Telemetry** or **send traces to multiple destinations at same time**, use this instead of X-Ray

## CloudTrail

- Allows **governance/compliance/auditing** for AWS
- **Enabled by default**
- Get history of events/API calls made within account by console/SDK/CLI/Services
- Can move logs from CloudTrail -> CloudWatch/S3
- Trails can be applied cross-region/single region
- If you want to know **why a resource was deleted, use CloudTrail**

### Events

- There are multiple type of events in CloudTrail
	- **Management Events**: Operations that are performed on resources in account; can filter by read/write events
		- Configuring security
		- Configuring Rules
	- **Data Events**: Operations that deal with data modification
		- S3 object-level activity (read/write filtering available)
		- Lambda function execution activity
	- **Insight Events**: Detects unusual activity in your account (only analyzes **write events**)
		- Inaccurate provisioning
		- Hitting service limits
- Events are stored for **90 days**; you can keep them longer by moving them to an S3 bucket and using **Athena**

## When to Use Each Service

- **CloudWatch** for performance and error monitoring.
- **CloudTrail** for auditing actions and security tracking.
- **X-Ray** for tracing and debugging your application's performance across multiple services.
