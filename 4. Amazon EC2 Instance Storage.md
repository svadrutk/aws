- **EBS Volume**: Network drive you can attach to instances
	- Allows for persistent data even if the instance terminates 
	- Can **only** be mounted to one instance at a time
	- Bound to 1 AZ
		- If you want to bind it to another AZ, you have to **snapshot** it first
	- *May be some latency* because it's a network drive
- EBS Volumes have a **delete on termination attribute** that must be unchecked if you want the EBS to not be deleted if the EC2 instance is
	- This only applies to **root volumes**, other volumes will not be deleted by default

## EBS Volume Types

- Several types of EBS Volumes: 
	- **gp2/gp3**: General purpose SSD ^9d8b5a
		- gp3 has a baseline of 3k IoPS and throughput of 125 MB/s ^e0d07f
			- However, can increase up to 16k  IoPS independently
		- Small gp2 volumes can also increase up to 16k IoPS but only depending on size
			- Since size and IoPS are linked, **max IoPS is reached @ 5.3GB**
	- **io1/io2 Block Express**: Highest-performance SSD for critical workloads ^ec3e84
		- For apps that need > 16k IoPS
		- Good for db workloads
		- Max IoPS for **io1** is **64k IoPS**
		- Max IoPS for **io2** is **256k IoPS**
		- Supports **EBS multi-attach**
			- Can attach same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances **in same AZ**
			- Each instance has R/W perms to volume
			- <= 16 EC2 instances
			- Must use cluster-aware FS
	- **st1 (HDD)**: Low-cost HDD for high throughput workloads
		- Max throughput is **500 MB/s**, max IoPS is **500 IoPS**
		- Good for big data, data warehouses, etc.
	- **sc1 (HDD)**: Lowest-cost HDD for poor people like me
		- Good for infrequent data access 
		- Max throughput is **250 MB/s**, max IoPS is **250 IoPS**
	- **ONLY THE SSD VOLUMES** can be used for boot
- **Snapshot**: Backup of an EBS volume ^ca1195
	- Recommended to detach volume before
	- Allows to copy EBS over AZ/Region
	- Can move a snapshot to an **archive tier** that is 75% cheaper
	- Can setup rules to retain accidentally deleted snapshots
		- Retains deleted snapshots from 1d-1y
- **AMI**: Amazon Machine Image (custom EC2 instance)  ^d03d85
	- Custom software/config/OS/monitoring
	- Faster boot time
	- Built for **specific regions** (can be copied)
- You can make an AMI by: 

Start EC2 Instance -> Customize it -> Stop Instance -> Build AMI -> Launch instances from other AMIs

- When EBS volumes aren't good enough, use **EC2 Instance Store** ^a5185b
	- Better I/O 
	- However, non-persistent if stopped
	- Good for buffer/cache/scratch/temporary content

## Amazon EFS -- Elastic File System

- Managed NFS (network file system) 
	- **Works in multi-AZ**
	- Very available -- but expensive
		- Pay per use
- Uses [[3. Amazon EC2 Fundamentals#Security Groups|security groups]] to manage EFS access
- Compatible with Linux-based [[#^d03d85|AMI]] 
	- POSIX file system 
- No capacity planning needed because EFS is automatically scalable 
	- Can grow to petabyte-scale networks
- Two performance modes: 
	- **General Purpose**: When you want low latency (web hosting)
	- **Max I/O**: Higher latency but also higher throughput and parallel (big data)
- **Storage Classes** help save on costs in file storage: 
	- **Standard**: for frequently accessed files
	- **Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)**: Put files that aren't frequently accessed here to save money  ^98aae8
	- **Archive**: Rarely accessed files, 50% cheaper storage cost
	- To successfully use this, one must implement lifecycle policies to move files between storage tiers
- Standard tier is multi-AZ and great for prod 
- One Zone is great for development and compatible with [[#^98aae8|EFS-IA]] but is one-AZ

## EBS/EFS Comparison 

* EBS volumes... 
	* are mostly one instance **except for [[#^ec3e84|io1/io2]]** 
	* Locked to a specific AZ 
	* For [[#^9d8b5a|gp2]], I/O increases if disk size increases
	* However, [[#^e0d07f|gp3]] can increase I/O independently
* To migrate an EBS volume across AZ: 
	* Take a [[#^ca1195|snapshot]] and copy it to another AZ 
		* You should detach the EBS when doing this
* EFS Volumes...
	* Can mount 100s of instances across AZs 
	* Good for hosting
	* **ONLY** for Linux instances
	* More expensive, but can use storage tiers to save money 
* **The three options for storage in Amazon are EFS, EBS, and [[#^a5185b|Instance Store]]**
