- **Amazon Cognito** allows users to interact with an app by giving them an **identity**
	- **User Pools** offer sign in functionality for app users; integrates with API Gateway + ALB
	- **Identity Pools** provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS resources directly; integrates with user pools

## User Pools

- Can create a **serverless database** of users for your apps
	- Username/password combo
	- Password rest available
	- Email + phone number verification
	- MFA
	- Can get identities from Facebook, Google, SAML
	- Can **block users** if their credentials are compromised elsewhere
- Login sends back a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**
	- Contains **Header, Payload, Signature**
		- **Payload** contains user info; retrieve user info from **sub UUID**
	- Signature must be **verified** to trust JWT
	- Can use **libraries** to verify this

- CUPs integrate with API Gateway + ALB
- CUPs can also **invoke Lambda functions** with certain triggers: 

## Hosted Authentication UI 

- Cognito has a **hosted authentication UI** that you can easily add to app for sign-up/in workflows
	- Can integrate with social logins, OIDC, SAML
	- Can customize with logo, CSS
- You can host this at a **custom domain**
	- Requires **ACM Certificate in us-east-1**
	- Must be defined in **App Integration section**

## Adaptive Authentication

- CUP can **block sign-ins/require MFA** for suspicious logins
	- Cognito generates a **risk score** for how likely the request is malicious
		- Based on device usage, location, IP
	- Can integrate with **CloudWatch Logs**

## Authentication w/ ALB

- You can **authenticate with ALB** through an **Identity Provider (OpenID Connect)** or with **Cognito User Pools**
- Requires using an **HTTPS listener** to set `authenticate-oidc` and `authenticate-cognito` rules
- Use the **`OnUnauthenticatedRequest`** to choose to authenticate/deny/allow 

### Cognito User Pools + ALB

- Create a **Cognito User Pool, Client, Domain**
	- Ensure it **returns ID token**
	- Add **social/corporate IdP**
	- Allow CUP Domain on your iDP app's callback URL
		- .https://domain-prefix.auth.**region**.amazoncognito.com/saml2/idpresponse
		- .https://user-pool-domain/oauth2/idpresponse

### IdP + ALB

- Create a **Client ID + Client Secret**
- Allow redirect from OIDC to ALB DNS name and CNAME
	- .https://DNS/oauth2/idpresponse
	- .https://CNAME/oauth2/idpresponse

## Cognito Identity Pools

- You can use identity pools to get identities for users to **obtain temp AWS creds**
- Can include: 
	- Public providers (Amazon, Google, FB)
	- Users in a CUP 
	- OpenID Connect Providers/SAML Identity Providers
	- Developer Authenticated identities
	- **(Unauthenticated)** guest access
- Users can then **access AWS services directly** or through API Gateawy
	- IAM Policies applied to credentials are defined in Cognito
	- Can be customized based on **user_id**
- You can configure **default IAM roles** for authenticated/guest useres
	- Define rules to choose role based on ID
	- Use **policy variables** to partition user access
	- IAM creds are **obtained through STS** by CIPs
	- Roles must have a **"trust" policy** of Cognito Identity Pools
