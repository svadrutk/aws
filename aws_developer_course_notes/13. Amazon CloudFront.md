- **CloudFront** is a **content delivery network (CDN)** like Wordpress
	- Better read performance (content is cached at **216 edge locations** around the world)
		- Improves UX
	- DDoS protection
- CloudFront can have 2 [[12. S3 Security#CORS|origins]]: 
	- **S3 Bucket Origin** for distributing files; better security with CloudFront Origin Access Control
		- CloudFront can be used to upload files to S3
	- **Custom Origin (HTTP)** for ALBs, EC2 instances, S3 websites; basically any HTTP backend
- CloudFront and [[9. Amazon S3 Introduction#Replication|S3 Cross Region Replication]] are used for different purposes: 
	- CloudFront is a **global edge network** and files are cached for a TTL. This is good for widely available **static content**
	- S3 Cross Region Replication must be **set up for each region**. Files are updated in near real-time, but it is **read-only**. This is good for **dynamic content** that needs to be available in only a **few regions**

## Caching

- There is a **cache** at each edge location
	- Objects in cache are identified with a **cache key**, a unique identifier for every object in the cache
		- Hostname + Resource Portion of URL
		- This can be changed with **CloudFront Cache Policies**
	- To maximize cache hits, you can clean up the cache with the **CreateInvalidation API**

### Cache Policies

- **Cache Policies** control what items in cache are identified by 
	- HTTP Headers
	- Cookies
	- Query Strings
- You can also use the cache policy to **control TTL**
- You can create your own policy or use predefined managed policies
- REMEMBER: All HTTP headers/cookies/query strings in cache key are **automatically included in origin requests**
- **HTTP Headers** (Content-Type, User-Agent, etc.)
	- **None**: Don't include any headers in cache key -> headers are not forwarded -> best caching performance
	- **Whitelist**: **only specified headers included** in cache key -> specified headers forwarded to origin 
- **Query Strings** (`?id=123&order=false...`)
	- **None**: Don't include query strings -> not forwarded
	- **Whitelist**: **only specified query strings included** in cache key -> specified strings are forwarded
	- **Include All-Except (Blacklist)**: Include all query strings in cache key except specified query strings 
	- **All**: Include all query strings in cache key
### Origin Request Policy 

- **Origin Request**: Specify values that you want to include in origin request without including them in cache key 
	- HTTP Headers
	- Cookies
	- Query Strings
- Can add HTTP headers/custom headers to an origin request without including it in the viewer request
	- Create own policy/use predefined managed policies

| Origin Request Policy                           | Cache Policy                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Controls what CloudFront **forwards** to origin | Controls what CloudFront **caches** and what it puts in cache key |
| Minimizes origin load                           | Optimizes performance/cost by caching content close to users      |

## Cache Invalidations

- CloudFront will only get newest version of origin after **TTL expires**
	- **CloudFront Invalidation** forces cache refresh (fully/partially)
		- Invalidate all files (\*) or specific path (/images/\*)

## Cache Behaviors

- Allows different settings for different URL path patterns 
	- `images/*.jpg` -> one specific cache behavior
- **Default Cache Behavior** is always **last** when adding custom cache behaviors

## Geo Restriction 

- Restrict access to CDN by country
	- **Allowlist**: Whitelist for allowed countries
	- **Blocklist**: Blacklist for banned countries
- Country <- 3rd party Geo-IP DB
- Good for copyright laws

## Signed URL/Signed Cookies 

- Good for distributing paid shared content to premium users
- Signed URL = access to individual files
- Signed Cookies = access to multiple files 


| CloudFront Signed URL                     | S3 Pre-Signed URL                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Allow access to path no matter the origin | Limited lifetime                             |
| Account wide key-pair                     | Uses IAM key of principal                    |
| Filter by IP/path/date/expiration         | Issue a request as person who pre-signed URL |
| Can use caching features                  |                                              |

- There are **two types of signers**:
	- **Trusted Key Groups** leverage APIs to create/rotate keys (and IAM)
	- **AWS Account w/ CloudFront Key Pair**: Need a root account and AWS console to manage keys; not recommended because you shouldn't use the root account for this
- You should create >= 1 **trusted key groups**
- Generate public/private key
	- **Private keys** are used by applications to sign URLs
	- **Public Key** is used by CloudFront to verify URLs

## Pricing

- Edge location pricing **varies**
- If you want to **reduce cost**, you can **reduce # of edge locations**
	- **Price Class All**: All regions, best performance
	- **Price Class 200**: Most regions except most expensive
	- **Price Class 100**: Least expensive regions

## Multiple Origins

- You can route to **different origins based on content type**
	- /images/* 
	- /api/* 
	- /* 

### Origin Groups

- **Origin Groups** increase HA and allow for better failover 
	- One primary/one secondary origin
- Secondary origin is used if primary fails

## Field Level Encryption

- Adds an **additional layer of security** along with HTTPS
- Sensitive info is encrypted at **each edge location**
- Uses **asymmetric encryption** (public key/private key)

## Real Time Logs

- You can send requests received by CloudFront to **Kinesis Data Streams**
	- Customize with **sampling rate** (\% of requests you want to receive) and **specific fields/cache behaviors** (path patterns)
