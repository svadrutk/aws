- **CI/CD** automates deployments of AWS resources. AWS has multiple services to this. 
	- **CodeCommit**: Store code w/ versioning
	- **CodePipeline**: Pipeline from code -> Elastic Beanstalk
	- **CodeBuild**: Build/test code
	- **CodeDeploy**: Deploy code to instances
	- **CodeStar**: Manage SWE activities 
	- **CodeArtifact**: Store/publish/share software packages
	- **CodeGuru**: Automated code reviews using ML (woah cool)

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Continuous Integration** is the process of pushing the code to a repository
	1. Code is pushed to repository
	2. Testing/build server checks code 
	3. Dev gets feedback about tests
- This allows **quick bug fixing, faster delivery, unblocked developers**

## Continuous Delivery

- **Continuous Delivery** ensures that the software can be **released reliably** whenever needed
	- Deployments are **often** and **quick**

## AWS CodeCommit

- CodeCommit includes **private Git repositories (no size limit)** that are fully managed, highly available
	- **Increased security** because you can only code in **AWS Cloud**
		- Git uses **SSH Keys** and **HTTPS** to authenticate
		- Uses **IAM policies** to manage repo access
		- Uses **AWS KMS** to encrypt repos
		- For **cross-account access** used an **IAM role** and use **AWS STS (AssumeRole API)**
	- Integrated with **Jenkins, CodeBuild, etc.**

| Security                    | IAM Users  | Github Users   |
| UI                          | Minimal    | Fully Featured |
## CodePipeline

- **CodePipeline** contains a **visual workflow** for CICD
	- **Source** -> CodeCommit/ECR/S3/BitBucket/Github
	- **Build** -> CodeBuild/Jenkins/CloudBees/TeamCity
	- **Test** -> CodeBuild/AWS Device Farm/3rd Party Tools
	- **Deploy** -> CodeDeploy/Elastic Beanstalk/CloudFormation/ECS/S3
	- **Invoke** -> Lambda/Step Functions
- Create **stages** that contain sequential/parallel actions
	- Build -> Test -> Test -> Load Testing
	- Approval can be defined at **any** stage
- **Artifacts** are created by stages; they are stored in an **S3 Bucket** and then passed on to the next stage
- You can use **CloudWatch Events** to help troubleshoot errors in pipeline; e.g. create an event for failed pipelines/cancelled stages
	- Stage Fail -> Get info from event
	- **Ensure correct IAM perms**
	- Use **CloudTrail** to audit API calls
## CodeBuild

- **CodeBuild** is a **fully managed** CI service
	- **Continuous Scaling**
	- Can **compile code**, **run tests**, **make packages**; uses **Docker** for reproducible builds
		- Prepackaged or custom images
	- Serves as an alternative to other tools like Jenkins
	- Charged **per minute**
	- Uses KMS for encryption, IAM for perms, CloudTrail for call logging
- **CodeBuild Process**
	- **Source** -> CodeCommit/S3/BitBucket/Github
	- **Build Instructions**: `buildspec.yml` or manually inserted instructions
	- **Output Logs**: Store in S3/CloudWatch
		- Use Metrics to monitor build statistics
	- **EventBridge**: Used to detect failed builds
- Supports
	- Java
	- Ruby
	- Python
	- Go
	- Node.JS
	- Android
	- .NET
	- PHP
	- Docker (any env)

### Example Buildspec.yml

- `env` is used to **define environment variables**
	- **Variables** -> Plaintext Vars
	- **Parameter-Store** -> Vars stored in SSM Parameter Store
	- **Secrets-Manager** -> Variables stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- `phases` is used to specify commands to run
	- **install** -> dependencies
	- **pre_build** -> final commands before build
	- **build** -> actual build commands
	- **post_builds** -> finishing touches
- `artifacts` specifies what to **upload to S3**
- `cache` is used to specify which files to cache to S3 for better build time

## CodeDeploy

- **CodeDeploy** automates app deployment
	- Deploy new versions to EC2 instances/servers/Lambda functions/ECS Services
- **Automated** rollback capability
- Gradual deployment control
- File named **appspec.yml** to define deployment
- You can define **deployment speed**
	- **AllAtOnce**
	- **HalfAtATime** -> Reduced capacity by 50%
	- **OneAtATime** -> Slowest but lowest availability impact
	- Custom
- The CodeDeploy **Agent** must be **running on the instances** as a prerequisite
	- Can be installed/updated automatically
	- Must have **sufficient perms**
- The **Lambda platform** allows traffic shift for Lambda aliases
	- Linear: grow traffic every N minutes until 100%
	- Canary: Try X percent then 100% 
	- AllAtOnce
- The **ECS Platform** has the same traffic shift methods, but **only for blue/green deployments**
- You can deploy to **EC2** using appspec.yml and the deployment strategy
	- In-place update to EC2 instances
	- Use **hooks** to verify deployment after each phase
- You can deploy to an **ASG**
	- **In-Place Deployment** -> Updates existing EC2 instances and newly created instances will get automated deployments
	- **Blue/Green Deployment** -> Creates new ASG 
- **Redeploy + Rollbacks**: Deployments can be rolled back **automatically** (use a CloudWatch Alarm)
	- If rollback -> CodeDeploy redeploys the last known good revision as a **new deployment**

## CodeStar

- **CodeStar** integrates GitHub, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, CodePipeline, CloudWatch
	- Create **CICD-Ready** projects for EC2/Lambda/EB
	- Supports C#, Go, HTML5, Java, Node, PHP, Python, Ruby
	- Supports issue tracking w/ Jira and Github Issues
	- Integrates w/ **Cloud9** to obtain a web IDE
	- One dashboard to view all components
	- Free
	- Limited customization
## CodeArtifact

- **CodeArtifact** helps with dependency management by allowing devs to **retrieve dependencies** from CodeArtifact
- **Resource policies** allow other accounts to access CodeArtifact
	- Principal can read **all/none packages**

## CodeGuru

- CodeGuru is an **ML-Powered** service for **automated code reviews** and **performance recommendations**
	- **CodeGuru Reviewer**: Automated code reviews for development
		- Identify critical issues/vulnerabilities/bugs
		- Supports **Java/Python**
		- Integrates w/ GitHub, BitBucket, AWS CodeCommit

		- Provides heap summary
		- Anomaly Detections
- **CodeGuru Agent Config**

		- Method A -> Method B -> Method C has a depth of 3
	- **MemoryUsageLimitPercent**: Memory percentage used by profiler
	- **MinimumTimeForReportingInMilliseconds**: duh
	- **ReportingIntervalInMilliseconds**: Interval that CodeGuru sends stats to CodeGuru
	- **SamplingIntervalInMilliseconds**: Sampling interval used to profile samples
## Cloud9
