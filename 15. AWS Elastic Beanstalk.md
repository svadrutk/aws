- **Elastic Beanstalk** combines all the other services (EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc.) and handles everything which allows the developer to **only focus on their code**
	- Free but you pay for underlying instances
	- Full control of config
- Supports: 
	- Go
	- Java SE, Tomcat
	- .NET Core Linux
	- .NET on Windows
	- Node.js
	- PHP
	- Python
	- Ruby
	- Packer Builder
	- Single/Multi-Container Docker
	- Preconfig Docker
## Components

- **Application**: Collection of Elastic Beanstalk components (environments, versions, configs, etc.)
- **Application Version**: Iteration of app code
- **Environment**: Collection of AWS resources running an app version
	- **Tiers**: Web Server Environment Tier, Worker Environment Tier
		- **Web Server Environment Tier**: Deploys/manages applications that handle HTTP(S) requests
		- **Worker Environment Tier**: Used for background processes used by web app
			- Uses an SQS queue to see tasks that have to be run 
	- You are able to create **multiple environments (dev, test, prod, etc.)**

## Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Modes

- **Single Instance**: Good for dev environments; uses 1 EC2 instance and an [[6. RDS + Aurora + Elasticache#^b7ab8d|RDS Master]] database
- **High Availability w/ Load Balancer**: Good for prod environments, has multiple availability zones and multiple EC2 instances with a load balancer

### Deployment Options for Updates

- **All at once**: Fastest, but there is downtime
	- Good for quick iterations in dev
- **Rolling**: Update a few instances at a time
	- App is running below capacity, able to set # of instances
	- App is running both versions at the same time
	- No additional cost, **long deployment**
- **Rolling with Additional Batches**: Like rolling but makes sure the old app is still available (no downtime)
	- App is running at capacity, can set bucket size
	- App is running both versions at same time
	- Small additional cost, **longer deployment**
	- **Good for prod**
- **Immutable**: Makes instances in a new ASG/deploys version to these instances and then swaps all instances at once
	- **Zero downtime**
	- High cost (double capacity)
	- **Longest deployment**
	- Allows for quick rollback
	- **Great for prod**
- **Blue Green**: Create a new env and switch over when ready 
	- Similar to Immutable but makes a whole new environment instead of an ASG
- **Traffic Splitting**: Send a small percent of traffic to a new deployment
	- Good for canary testing
	- **Zero downtime**
	- Good for failover

## Elastic Beanstalk CLI 

- Can work with EB from the CLI 
	- `eb create`
	- `eb status`
	- `eb health`
	- `eb events`
	- `eb logs`
	- `eb open`
	- `eb deploy`
	- `eb config`
	- `eb terminate`
## Deployment Process

1. Describe dependencies (`requirements.txt, package.json`, etc. )
2. Package code as zip 
3. Upload zip file (deploy)
4. EB deploys the zip on each EC2 instance, downloads dependencies, starts app 
## Beanstalk Lifecycle Policy

- <= 1000 app versions
- You have to remove app versions to deploy more
- Use a **lifecycle policy**
	- Based on time
	- Based on space
- Currently used versions won't be deleted

## EB Extensions

- Customize environment that app runs in 
	- Install software
	- Run scripts
	- Modify AWS resource settings
- **Requirements**
	- Uses an `.ebextensions` file
	- YAML/JSON format
	- Uses `.config` extensions
- Resources managed by `.ebextensions` **get deleted if environment dies**

## EB Cloning

- You can **clone** an environment with the same configuration to have a test version of app; everything is preserved
	- Load Balancer type/config
	- RDS database type (w/o data)
	- Env vars
- This is good if you want to **change your load balancer** since you can't do it after you initialize the environment
	- Clone the environment and change load balancer to the one you want
- You can also **migrate your RDS**
	- Create a snapshot of RDS DB (safety)
	- Protect RDS database from deletion
	- Create new EB environment, and point it to existing RDS
		- Perform CNAME swap/Route 53 update
	- Terminate old environment
	- Delete CloudFormation stack
