## AWS Step Functions

- **Step Functions** help model workflows as **state machines** (1 per)
	- Good for order fulfillment/data processing/web apps/etc. 
- Written in JSON 
- Able to **visualize workflow and its execution + history**
	- Start workflow w/ SDK call/API Gateway/EventBridge

### Task States

- **Task States** are the smallest unit of a state machine that performs **one task**
	- Invoke **one AWS service**; can be a Lambda, Batch Job, ECS task, etc. 
	- Run **one activity**; Activities poll step functions for work and return result back to step function
- There are different types of states: 
	- **Choice State**: Test for a condition to send to branch (if-else)
	- **Fail/Succeed State**: **Stop** execution w/ failure or success
	- **Pass State**: **Pass** input to output without performing work
	- **Wait State**: **Delay** until a specific time
	- **Map State**: Dynamically iterate steps
	- **Parallel State**: Begin parallel branches of execution

### Error Handling

- If errors come up, you can use **Retry** (for retrying failed state) and **Catch** (go to failure path) in the state machine to handle errors 
	- **StatesALL**: Any error name
	- **States.TimeOut**: Timeout error
	- **States.TaskFailed**: Execution failure
	- **States.Permissions**: Incorrect perms
- For **Retry**:
	- **ErrorEquals**: For specific type of error
	- **IntervalSeconds**: Delay before retrying for first time
	- **BackOffRate**: Configure level of exponential backoff
	- **MaxAttempts**: Default 3; after this, path goes to **Catch**
- For **Catch**: 
	- **ErrorEquals**: For specific type of error
	- **Next**: State to send to 
	- **ResultPath**: Path that determines what input is sent to state specified in Next field
		- `"ResultPath": "$.error` sends error to input in next state

### Wait For Task Token 

- **WaitForTaskToken**: **Pause** a step function during a task until a **task token** is returned
	- Token may come from other AWS services, human approval, etc. 

### Activity Tasks

- **Activity Tasks** allow the task to be performed by an **Activity Worker**
	- Can be running on EC2/Lambda/Mobile
	- Activity Workers poll for a task using **GetActivityTask API**
- Activity Worker then **sends response** using **SendTaskSuccess/SendTaskFailure API**
- Keep a task active by configuring **TimeoutSeconds** and **SendTaskHeartbeat**; you can keep an activity task waiting <=1y

## AppSync

- **AppSync** is an AWS service that uses **GraphQL**
	- Allows apps to get specified data easily 
	- Can combine data from a lot of sources
	- Retrieve in real-time w/ WebSocket
	- Good for **local data access, data sync**
- AppSync is secured with several things: 
	- **API_KEY**
	- **AWS_IAM**: IAM roles
	- **OPENID_CONNECT**: OpenID Connect Provider/JWT
	- **AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS**
- Use **CloudFront** in front of AppSync for custom domains/HTTPS
## AWS Amplify 

- **AWS Amplify** is a set of tools to create mobile and web apps
	- "Elastic Beanstalk" for mobile/web apps
	- Contains data storage, authentication, etc. 
- Amplify uses **AWS Cognito** to authenticate users and **AppSync/DynamoDB** for data storage
- Also contains a hosting service that has CICD capabilities, pull request previews, etc. 
- Can do **E2E (End-To-End) Testing** to catch regressions before pushing code
	- Use `amplify.yml` to run any test commands at build
	- Integrated with **Cypress Framework**
