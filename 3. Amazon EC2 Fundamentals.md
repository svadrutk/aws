- **EC2** stands for Elastic Compute Cloud (IaaS)
	- Rent VMs (EC2)
	- Data storage (EBS)
	- Load balancing (ELB)
	- Service Scaling (ASG)
## Sizing and Configuration Options

There are many configuration options to get the exact machine to fit one's needs. 

- **OS**: MacOS, Windows, Linux
- **CPU**: Computing power & cores needed
- **RAM**: Amount of random-access memory needed
- **EBS/EFS**: Network-attached storage space (better for long-term data)
- **EC2 Instance Store**: Hardware storage space (better for caching and other temp storage)
- **Network Card**: Speed of network card, public/private IP 
- **Firewall Rules**: security group (?)
- **Bootstrap Script**: EC2 User Data
	- Run ***once*** at machine start, does stuff like 
		- Installing updates
		- Installing software
		- Downloading files from Internet
		- etc.
	- This script only runs with the **root user**.

EC2 has many different instance types that are optimized for different purposes. The naming convention is as follows: 

```
m5.2xlarge
```

- **m**: instance class
- **5**: generation 
- **2xlarge**: size within instance class

### EC2 Instance Types

- **General Purpose**: Applies to most use cases: web servers, code repos, etc. 
	- Balance between computing power, memory, and networking
	- This course uses the t2.micro which is a general purpose EC2 instance. 
- **Compute Optimized**: Good for tasks that require intensive computing like: 
	- Media transcoding
	- High performance computing
- **Memory Optimized**: Good for tasks that need to process large datasets fast like: 
	- Relational/non-relational Databases 
	- Distributed web scale cache stores
	- Apps that perform real-time processing of big unstructured data 
- **Storage Optimized**: Good for storage-intensive tasks that need high read/write access to big datasets on local storage like: 
	- High-frequency OLTP systems 
	- Relational/NoSQL databases
	- Cache for in-memory databases
	- Data warehousing applications
	- Distributed filesystems


| Instance    | vCPU | Mem (GiB) | Storage      | Network Performance | EBS Bandwidth |
| ----------- | ---- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| t2.micro    | 1    | 1         | EBS-Only     | Low - Med           |               |
| t2.xlarge   | 4    | 16        | EBS-Only     | Med                 |               |
| c5d.4xlarge | 16   | 32        | 400 NvME SSD | <= 10GB/s           | 4750          |
| r5.16xlarge | 64   | 512       | EBS-Only     | 20 GB/s             | 13600         |
| m5.8xlarge  | 32   | 128       | EBS-Only     | 10 GB/s             | 6800          |
## Security Groups 

^a4344b

- **Security Groups** control traffic in/out of EC2 instances  ^ee137e
	- Port access
	- Authorized IP ranges (IPv4 - v6)
- Security Groups **only** contain **allow** rules
	- Rules can be referenced by IP or security group

![[Pasted image 20240924163544.png]]

- SCs can be attached to **multiple** instances 
	- But are locked to a region/VPC combo
	- Lives outside the EC2 (if it blocks traffic the instance won't see it)
- **Good to maintain one SC for SSH access**
- TROUBLESHOOTING
	- App time out -> Security Group issue
	- App "connection refused" -> App issue
- All inbound is **blocked** by default
- All outbound is **allowed** by default

### Ports to Know

- **22**: SSH 
- **21**: FTP (upload files into a fileshare)
- **22**: SFTP (upload files w/ SSH)
- **80**: HTTP
- **443**: HTTPS
- **3389**: RDP (log onto Windows instance)

## EC2 Instances: Purchasing Options

- **On-Demand Instances**: Short workload, pay by second
	- Highest cost but no upfront payment
	- No long-term commitment
	- Recommended for short-term and uninterrupted workloads
- **Reserved (1 & 3 yrs)**: Long workloads
	- Up to 72% discount compared to on-demand
	- Reserves a specific instance attribute
	- Payment options: 
		- No Upfront (+discount)
		- Partial Upfront (++discount)
		- All Upfront (+++discount)
	- Reserved Instance's Scope: 
		- Regional
		- Zonal
	- Recommended for steady-state apps
- **Savings Plans (1 & 3 yrs)**: Buy an amount of usage (long workload)
	- Discount based on long-term usage 
	- Commit to a certain type of usage
	- Usage beyond plan is billed at **on-demand price**
	- Locked to a specific instance family/AWS region
	- Flexible across
		- Instance Size
		- OS
		- Tenancy
- **Spot Instances***: Short workloads, risk of loss
	- Can get discount up to 90%
	- Can lose them at any time if your max price < current spot price 
	- **Most cost-efficient**
	- Good for resilient workloads that won't tweak out if the machine breaks
	- NOT good for critical jobs/databases
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Entire physical server
	- Good for softwares with complicated licensing models 
	- Companies with big compliance needs 
	- **Most expensive**
- **Dedicated Instances**: Unshareable instances
	- Instances run on hardware that is dedicated to you 
	- Can share hardware with other instances **in same account**
- **Capacity Reservations**: Reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
	- No time commitment
	- No billing discounts
	- Charged at on-demand rate if you run instances or not 
	- Good for short-term uninterrupted workloads that need to be in a specific AZ 
### As an analogy...

- **ON DEMAND**: Coming and staying in a resort whenever we like (pay full price)
- **RESERVED**: Planning ahead for a long stay; may get a good discount
- **SAVINGS PLANS**: Pay a certain amount /hr for a period and stay in any room type 
- **SPOT INSTANCES**: Bid for a room, higher bidder always gets the room even if there's someone in it 
- **DEDICATED HOSTS**: Booking an entire resort building 
- **CAPACITY RESERVATIONS**: Book a room for a period for full price even if you don't use it
