## RDS

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: AWS's service for databases; includes services for multiple types of databases: 
	- PostgreSQL 
	- MySQL 
	- MariaDB
	- Oracle
	- Microsoft SQL Server
	- IBM DB2 
	- **Aurora**
- RDS is better to use than EC2 because it is a *managed service*.
	- But you **can't SSH**.

### Storage Auto Scaling

- RDS will **scale automatically** when you run out of DB storage
	- Set a **Maximum Storage Threshold** to control point of scaling
- Automatically modifies storage if:
	- Storage reaches **90% capacity**
	- Low-storage lasts **>= 5 min**
	- **6 hr cooldown** for modifications
- Supports **all** RDS engines

### Read Replicas

- **Read Replicas**: Read-only replicas of a database to reduce load on primary database
	- **<= 15** Read Replicas 
	- Can be anywhere from Within AZ -- Cross Region
	- Replication is **ASYNC** so it takes a bit for replicas to match original 
	- Replicas can be **promoted** to a database 
- **Use Cases**
	- Run analytics on read replicas to leave production apps unaffected 
	- REMEMBER: Read replicas are **only used for SELECT statements**
- **Network Cost**: Cost for data to move AZs 
	- Network cost is **free** for Read Replicas in **same region**

### Multi AZ

- RDS databases can be setup as multi AZ for disaster recovery; all of them have the **same DNS name**
- You can go from **Single AZ -> Multi-AZ**
	- Click "modify" on database ^4d1d71
		1. Snapshot is taken
		2. New DB is restored from snapshot in new AZ
		3. SYNC is enabled

### RDS Proxy

- **RDS Proxy**: a proxy for RDS that allows apps to pool and share DB connections
	- Improves efficiency by minimizing open connection
	- Serverless/autoscaling/HA
	- Reduced failover time (<=66%)
	- Supports **RDS + Aurora**
	- RDS proxy is **never publicly accessible**


## Aurora

- Proprietary
- Supports **Postgres** and **MySQL**
- "AWS Cloud Optimized" -- much faster than RDS 
- Storage scales in **increments of 10GB**
- Read Replica process is faster than MySQL
- Failover is instantaneous; it's [[5. High Availability and Scalability#^410dd2|HA]] native
- 20% more expensive, but more efficient

### High Availability and Read Scaling

- **6 copies** of database across **3 AZs**
	- **4/6** copies needed for **writes**
	- **3/6** copies needed for **reads**
	- Self healing with P2P replication
	- Storage is **striped** across 100s of volumes
- **Master** Aurora instance takes **writes** ^b7ab8d
	- Failover happens <30s
- Master + Read Replicas serve reads
- Supports **Cross Region Replication** w/ [[#^4d1d71|snapshots]]

## RDS + Aurora Security

- **At-Rest encryption** happens when the DB isn't doing anything; uses **AWS KMS** (defined at launch time) to encrypt data
	- Master must be encrypted for read replicas to be encrypted
	- Encrypt an un-encrypted database by going through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted
- **In-Flight encryption** happens during requests -- usually uses **AWS TLS** root certificate client-side
- IAM Roles to connect to DB 
- [[3. Amazon EC2 Fundamentals#^ee137e|Security Groups]] for network access
- **NO SSH** except for custom RDS instances

## ElastiCache

- **Elasticache** is used to store caches/in-memory databases
	- Reduces load off of DBs for read-intensive workloads
	- Ensures stateless application
	- AWS takes care of everything
	- **However**, using Elasticache involves **heavy code changes**
- App will query Elasticache and then RDS/Aurora if data not in Elasticache, then add data to Elasticache
	- Cache must have an **invalidation strategy** to keep the newest data
- There are two types of ElastiCache -- **Redis** and **Memcached**
	- **Redis**
		- High Availability with auto-failover
		- Read Replicas
		- Data Durability using AOF persistence
		- Backup/restore
		- Supports sets/sorted sets
		- Max 5 Read Replicas
	- **Memcached**
		- Multi-node for partitioning of data
		- No HA
		- Non-persistent
		- No backup/restore
		- Multi-threaded architecture
- There are two methods of caching implementation: **Lazy Loading** and **Write Through**
	- **Lazy Loading**: Only requested data is cached and node failures are not fatal
		- But cache miss penalty is really bad and data can be updated in the databases but outdated in cache
	- **Write Through**: Updates cache whenever DB is updated
		- Pros: Reads are quick but writes are slow
		- Cons: Data is missing until it is added to the database, lot of the data will never be read so it's a waste of space

### Cache Evictions + TTL 

- **Cache Eviction**: Process of removing data from cache for space. It can happen in three ways: 
	- Cache item is **explicitly deleted**
	- LRU (least recently used) policy to delete items
	- TTL (time-to-live) for an item
