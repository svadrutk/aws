- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Converts hostnames -> IP addresses
	- www.google.com -> 172.217.18.36
	- Uses a hierarchical naming structure
		- .com -> example.com -> www.example.com -> api.example.com
- Route 53 is a **domain registrar** -- other examples include GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc. 
- **DNS Records**: Instructions for conversion to IPs 
	- A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME (domain -> domain -- can't make for www.xxx.xxx but can create for xxx.xxx), [[#^71206e|NS]]
- **Zone File**: Contains DNS records
- **Name Server**: Resolves DNS queries using the zone file ^71206e
	- **Authoritative Query**: DNS server has definitive information about the domain
	- **Non-Authoritative Query**: DNS server gets domain data by querying other DNS servers (**recursive**)
- **Top Level Domain**: .com/.us/.in/.gov/.org
- **Second Level Domain**: amazon.com, google.com, etc.

## DNS Process

1. User wants to find the IP address for example.com 
2. User checks local cache for IP, can't find it so it sends request to **local DNS server** (run by local ISP (internet service provider))
3. Local DNS server sends request to **Root DNS server**
4. Root DNS server sends **TLD server** for .com to local DNS server
5. Local DNS server queries TLD server for example.com 
6. TLD server sends **SLD server** for example.com to DNS server
7. Local DNS server queries SLD server for IP address
8. Local DNS server sends IP back to web browser and web browser caches it for later

## Route 53

- HA/scalable/fully managed/**Authoritative** DNS 
	- **Authoritative**: customer can update DNS records
- Also a Domain Registrar
- Provides 100% availability

### DNS Records for Route 53

- Each record contains several parts: 
	- **Domain/subdomain Name** (example.com)
	- **Record Type** -- A/AAAA/CNAME/NS
	- **Value** (IP)
	- **Routing Policy** -- how Route 53 responds to queries
	- **TTL** -- Time record is cached
		- High TTL implies less traffic but more outdated records
		- Low TTL implies more traffic ($) but more up-to-date records
		- TTL is **mandatory** for everything **except Alias** records

### Hosted Zones

- **Hosted Zones**: Container for DNS records
	- **Public**: Record container for public domains 
	- **Private**: Record container for VPCs (private domains)

### Alias Records

- **Automatically recognizes changes** in IPs
- ALWAYS type **A/AAAA**
- No TTL
- Targets include:
	- ELB
	- CloudFront Distributions
	- API Gateway
	- Elastic Beanstalk
	- S3 sites
	- VPC endpoints
	- Route 53 record in **same hosted zone**

#### CNAME vs Alias

| CNAME                                                       | Alias                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| hostname -> hostname                                        | hostname -> AWS Resource |
| only works for **non-root domain** (something.mydomain.com) | works on **all domains** |
| costs money                                                 | free                     |
| **no** native health checks                                 | native health checks     |

### Health Checks 

- Health checks are only for **public resources**
- There are several types of health checks: 
	- Monitoring an endpoint (app/server/etc.)
	- Monitoring other health checks
	- Monitoring CloudWatch alarms (good for private resources)
- Integrated w/ CW metrics

#### Monitoring Endpoint

- Consists o/ ~15 health checkers
	- Intervals are at default 30s (smaller interval = greater cost)
	- **>18%** health checkers report healthy => Endpoint is healthy
		- Else unhealthy
	- Can choose which locations Route 53 uses for checks
- Healthy only if 2xx/3xx status code
	- Can also pass/fail based on first **5120 bytes** of response
- Make sure [[3. Amazon EC2 Fundamentals#^a4344b|Security Groups]] allow health checkers

#### Calculated Health Checks

- Combine health checks into one health check
	- Use **OR/AND/NOT** to **pass/fail** 
	- **<= 256** combined checks
- You can use this to **perform maintenance on website** without causing **all health checks to fail**

#### Private Hosted Zones

- Since health checkers **cannot access VPC**, you can bypass this by setting a **CloudWatch Alarm** that is checked by the health checker

### Route 53 -- Routing Policies 

- **Routing Policies** define how Route 53 responds to DNS queries

#### Simple Routing Policy

- Routes traffic to a **single resource**
- Can specify **multiple policies** in same record
	- Random one is chosen out of these by client
- Alias can **only specify one** AWS resource
- **No health checks**

#### Weighted

- Controls proportion of requests -> each resource 
	- Each request gets a specific **weight** (don't need to sum up to 100)

$$
traffic(\%) = \frac{\text{Weight for specific record}}{\sum \text{All weights}}
$$
- Records must have **same name and type**
- **Allows health checks**
- Best for load balancing cross-region, testing new app versions
	- Stop sending traffic to resource -> weight = 0
	- If **all records** have **weight of 0**, all records will be returned **equally**

#### Latency-Based 

- Redirects to resource that has **least latency**
	- Good for low-latency use cases 
- Latency is based on **traffic** between users <--> AWS regions
- **Allows health checks**

#### Geolocation 

- Based on **user location**
	- specified by continent/country/US state
- Should create a "default" record if no location is found
- Used for website localization, content censoring, load balancing
- **Allows health checks**

#### Geoproximity

- Based on **user/resource proximity**
	- Can use **bias** -> **shift more traffic to resources**
	- Greater bias (1-99) = More traffic to resource
- Resources can be AWS/non-AWS resources (**latitude/longitude** must be specified for **non-AWS resources**)
	- **Requires Traffic Flow**
	- **Traffic Flow**: UI for DNS record configurations
		- Configs are saved as **Traffic Flow Policies**
			- Applied to different hosted zones, supports versioning

#### IP-Based Routing

- Routing is based on **clients' IP Addresses**
	- Provide CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) for clients and corresponding endpoints
- Good if you want to route users from an ISP -> endpoint

#### Multi-Value 

- Good if you want to route traffic -> multiple resources
	- Returns multiple values/resources
	- Associated w/ health checks (e.g. return only healthy resources)
	- <= 8 healthy records returned for each multi-value query
	- **NOT A SUBSTITUTE** for ELB

## Domain Registrar vs. DNS Service

| Domain Registrar         | DNS Service         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Buy/register domain name | Manages DNS records |

- To use a 3rd party domain registrar w/ Route 53, you can: 
	1. Create **hosted zone** in Route 53
	2. Map NS records on 3rd party website -> Route 53 name servers
