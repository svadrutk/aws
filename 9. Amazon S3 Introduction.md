- **S3**: "Infinitely Scaling" **object storage** (as opposed to relational storage like [[6. RDS + Aurora + Elasticache#RDS|RDS]] or [[6. RDS + Aurora + Elasticache#Aurora|Aurora]])
	- Used for many things: 
		- Backup/storage
		- Disaster Recovery
		- Archive
		- Hybrid Cloud storage 
		- Application Hosting
		- Media Hosting
		- Data Lakes & Big Data Analytics
		- Software Delivery
		- Static Websites
## Buckets

- **Buckets (directories)** store objects (files)
	- Must have a **globally unique name**
	- Defined at region level 
- There is a very specific **naming convention** for buckets
	- No uppercase/underscore
	- 3-63 chars 
	- Not an IP 
	- Must start with **lowercase letter/number**
	- CANNOT start with prefix **xn--**
	- CANNOT end with suffix **-s3alias**

## Objects 

- Object have a **key** and **value**
	- **Key**: FULL path of an object basically
		- s3://my-bucket/**my-file.txt**
		- Composed of a **prefix + object name**
		- IMPORTANT: **No concept o/ directories**
	- **Value**: Content of object body
		- Object size <= **5TB**
		- You can upload bigger files but you gotta use a **multi-part upload**
		- Includes **metadata, tags, version ID**

## Security

- **User-Based**: uses [[2. AWS Identity & Access Management (AWS IAM)#Example Policy|IAM Policies]] 
- **Resource-Based**
	- **Bucket Policies** are bucket-wide rules (**allows cross account**)
	- **Object Access Control List**: More granularity
	- **Bucket Access Control List**: Less common
- S3 can be accessed by IAM account IF: 
	- **IAM Policy ALLOWS** or **Resource Policy ALLOWS it**
		- NO EXPLICIT DENY 

## Bucket Policies 

^1d3fcb

- **JSON-Based Policies**

```json
{
"Version": "2012-10-17", // version
"Statement": [
		"Sid": "PublicRead" ,
		"Effect": "Allow", // allow/deny
		"Principal": "*", // account to apply policy
		"Action": { // APIs that policy applies to
			"s3:GetObject"
		}
		"Resource": { // buckets/objects
			"arn:aws: s3::: examplebucket/*"
		}
	]
}
```

- You can used S3 buckets for policy to: 
	- Grant **public access**
	- Force objects to be **encrypted**
	- Grant access to another account

## Static Website Hosting

- S3 can host **static** websites and provides a URL for them: 
	- .http://**bucket-name**.s3-website-**aws-region**.amazonaws.com
- To debug a **403 Forbidden**, check if the bucket policy allows **public reads** 
## Versioning 

- You should **version** buckets to protect against **unintended deletes** and allow for **easy rollback**
	- Enabled at **bucket label**
- Any file that is not versioned before enabling version will have **version null**

## Replication

- Requires **versioning** in both **source/destination buckets**
	- Cross-Region Replication (CRR) 
		- Good for lower latency and replication across accounts
	- Same-Region Replication (SRR) 
		- Good for getting logs, replication between dev/prod 
- Buckets can be in **different AWS accounts**
- Copying is **async**
- Requires **proper IAM permissions**
- **Only new** objects are replicated after replication is enabled
	- You can bypass with **S3 Batch Replication**
- Can optionally replicate **delete markers** from source target
	- Version ID deletes are **not replicated**
- Replication is **not transitive**

## Durability/Availability

- S3 is **very highly durable**
- Availability **varies** based on **storage class**
## Storage Classes

- **S3 Standard (General Purpose)**
	- 99.99% Availability
	- Good for frequently accessed data
	- Low latency/high throughput
	- Good for big data analytics/mobile+gaming apps/content distribution
- **S3 Standard -- IA (Infrequent Access)**
	- 99.9% Availability
	- Good for data that is -- you guessed it -- infrequently accessed
	- Lower cost
	- Good for disaster recovery/backups
- **S3 One Zone IA**
	- Very high durability in one AZ but dies if AZ is destroyed
	- 99.5% Availability
	- Good for secondary backup copies/recreatable data
- **S3 Glacier Storage Classes**: 
	- Low-cost storage for archiving
	- Costs for storage + object retrieval 
	- **Glacier Instant Retrieval**: Data accessed 1x/quarter, have to store it for minimum 90d
	- **Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: Has multiple retrieval options: 
		- Expedited (1-5m)
		- Standard (3-5hr)
		- Bulk (5-12hr) -- free
		- Minimum 90d storage
	- **Glacier Deep Archive**: For long-term storage
		- Standard (12hr)
		- Bulk (48hr)
		- Minimum storage o/ 180d
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**
	- Costs a small amount of money 
	- Moves objects **automatically** between access tiers **based on usage**
	- **No retrieval charges**
