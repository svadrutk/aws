- To save money you can move between [[9. Amazon S3 Introduction#Storage Classes|storage classes]] using **lifecycle rules**

## Lifecycle Rules

- **Transition Actions**: Config for objects to <--> between storage classes
- **Expiration Actions**: Config objects to die after some time
	- Delete old file versions
	- Delete incomplete multi-part uploads
- Rules can be created for a **certain prefix** or **certain object tags**
## Storage Class Analysis

- Helps decide when to transition objects between storage classes
	- Does **not** apply to **one-zone IA** + **Glacier**
	- 24-48 hrs to see analysis
- Recommended as a **first step** when using S3

## S3 Event Notifications

- Good for triggering other AWS services (lambda functions, pipeline automation)
- **Use Case**: Generate thumbnails when an image is uploaded to s3

## S3 Performance

- S3 **automatically scales** to high request rates 
	- Max requests per second is 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5500 GET/HEAD per prefix per bucket
- So you can put **unlimited prefixes in bucket**

### Prefixes

| Object Path              | Prefix        |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| bucket/folder1/sub1/file | /folder1/sub1 |
| bucket/1/file            | /1/           |
### Multi-Part Upload

- Good for files > 100MB, **required** for **> 5GB** files
	- Helps parallelize uploads (speed up)

### Transfer Acceleration

- **Transfer Acceleration** is the process of transferring a file to an **edge location** that forwards the data to the bucket in target region
### Byte-Range Fetches

- **Byte Range Fetches** requests specific byte ranges of a file
	- Better failure resilience
	- Parallelizes GETS (**speeds up downloads**)
	- Can be used to retrieve **partial data**

## Select + Glacier Select

- **Server-side filtering** uses simple SQL statements to allow for less network transfer/less client-side CPU cost

## Object Metadata + S3 Object Tags

- **User-Defined Object Metadata**
	- Name-value pairs
	- **Must** begin with **x-amz-meta-**
	- Can be retrieved when retrieving object
- **Object Tags**
	- Key-value pairs
	- Good for **fine-grained permissions**, **analytics**
- **Cannot search** object metadata OR tags
