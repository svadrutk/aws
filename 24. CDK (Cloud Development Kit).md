- You can use the **AWS Cloud Development Kit** to define CloudFormation templates in your preferred language:
	- Supports JS/TS, Python, Java, .NET
- Contains **constructs** that define different parts of a template
	- **L1**: CloudFormation Resources; usually start with **Cfn**. This requires **explicit configuration** of all resource properties
	- **L2**: AWS Service Constructs; abstracts CloudFormation resources into presets; has convenient defaults. You have to **provide methods** that make it easier to work with the resource
	- **L3**: Patterns (combinations of multiple resources; Lambda + API Gateway, etc.)
- Code is compiled into a JSON/YAML template
- Good for **Lambda functions**, **Docker containers**

- You can **use SAM CLI** to test your CDK apps with `cdk synth`

## Commands

- `npm install -g aws-cdk-lib`: Install CDK CLI + Libraries
- `cdk init app`: create new CDK project from specified template
- `cdk synth`: Synthesizes CloudFormation template from code
- `cdk bootstrap`: Deploys CDK Toolkit staging stack
- `cdk diff`: View diffs between local CDK and deployed stack
- `cdk destroy`: Destroy CloudFormation stack

## Bootstrapping

- You have to **bootstrap** CDK before deploying apps (provision resource)
	- **CDKToolkit** is a CloudFormation stack that contains an **S3 bucket** for files and **IAM Roles** to grant perms for deployment
- For each environment, you **have to run**

```
cdk bootstrap aws://<aws_account>/<aws_region>
```

- If you don't do this, you will get an error that says "**Policy contains a statement with one or more invalid principal**"

## Testing

- You can use the **CDK Assertions Module** with **Jest (JS)** or **Pytest (Python)** to test CDK apps
	- **Fine-grained assertions**: Test specific aspects of template
	- **Snapshot tests**: Test synthesized CloudFormation template against a baseline template
- **Import templates** with 
	- `Template.fromStack(MyStack)`: Stack from CDK
	- `Template.fromString(mystring)`: Stack build outside CDK
